<div><span><div>Ladies And Gentlemen of the Benevolent Order of Patrones [BOoP]</div><div><br/></div><div>I am so energized by all of the upcoming opportunities around me that I haven't slept at all so far this year, I'm sure I'm not the only one in this crowd to be in that boat but I want to let you in on what may be some unexpected bullet points in the 2018 Patrone Agenda.<br/>Last night was only the second New Years Eve in my musical career that I didn't perform and I enjoyed spending some quiet time while the facebook feed was thrumming away with fireworks and fanfare for the dying of a year which seems to have taken its toll on myself and on most of my friends and fellow entertainers. I consider 17 to be my luckiest number, my birthday,  7/17/71, is just the first of a million times that a 1,7 combo has appeared in my life; and, naturally I had some great expectations for 2017, a year which mostly had me standing in the cold for much longer than it should have taken me to realize that the fire with which I was trying to warm myself was just one of those apps flickering in an otherwise dormant storefront window.</div><div><br/></div><div>I found that I really lost the desire to entertain. it felt like falling out of love, with the cellphone wielding audience; or more likely myself, as I watched in disbelief at the cascade of integrity that seemed to get even our dryest institutions a little wet. Showing off for an audience, which always used to bring me so much energy, started to feel like a meaningless gesture in lieu of all the carnage in US Politics and Weather; while the flood of internationaI crisis and inhumanity was oppressive in its brutality and scope to say the least, cap that with the revelations of abuse exposing a shocking number of accusations and acqiescence of influencers whose quiet resignations almost seemed like intimate betrayals for the trusted positions of influence which they held and the access to our opinions which we allowed them. I dont think I need to go into details or denominations for us to agree that 2017 was a year that many of us were glad bid adieu. If it werent for the VA and bitcoin I would have been homeless for sure. Thankfully I bought a couple hundred dollars of bitcoin when it was $900 and that lucky move paid my rent and bills although just barely, being such a small amount, I am grateful that its meteoric rise played a powerful part in my year, even though I had sold it all before it really shot through the roof, the word &quot;cryptocurrency&quot; alone elicits a bittersweet emotional response that stands toe to toe with the effect of hearing any name attached to a broken heart, like &quot;The Philadelphia Eagles&quot; (I apologize for that obvious deflection) cue Tony Bennett, &quot;Maybe This Time&quot; </div><div>On to 2018, and the possibilities are endless! I have been using my vast contacts from the entertainment industry to gain afoothold in the burgeoning cannabis industry which has, as of today become recreationally legal to possess and use in the state of California. i thought i would have heard more revelry in the streets this morning; but, that's probably due to the dominance of Indica out here. I've been meeting farmers and learning a tremendous amount about the agricultural industry, cultivation and how the dynamic effects and benefits of this plant are largely ignored in our society. which brings me to to subject of prohibition.</div><div>Many of you have been on this list since before I began broadcasting The Speakeasy, which was my way of answering my own questions about where the country was headed, why and how we got to where we are, or were, in 2009. needless to say, 2009 seems like a period of extreme stability compared to where we find ourselves today. We called it the Speakeasy because it seemed like very few people really were paying attention to what was going on and they were also the folks who were living in a construct that mostly avoided the consequences of where we seemed yo be headed.</div><div>Then I split for the Pacific Crest Trail, took a break in Tahoe and was welcomed home to Black Rock City, a place I'd never been before, where I discovered a long lost family of souls who were likewise getting reacquainted after a millenia or two of independence. You're probably going to have to have attended Burning Man for that sentence to be true, or even make sense for that matter. dont worry if you haven't been yet, it was always better next year.</div><div>Speaking of, the next year I embarked upon a rocky ride which had me taking up the role of Fella Fitzgerald, playing and coaching Ice Hockey, taking a wrong turn in Palm Springs, being resuscitated, assembling and publishing the first collection of my writing &quot;Napkin Diaries.&quot; I don't mean to euphemize the dramatic details but I wouldn't want to spoil the book, or sales of course :-) which aren't dead; they just smell funny (as Frank Zappa liked to say about Jazz.)</div><div>Anyway, a few surprises later and here we are, on the verge of the death of the &quot;War On Drugs&quot; which has had, in my opinion, a more damaging effect on this country than any war in our history, even the Civil War, which I find strikingly similar in its pitting brother against brother over an issue which is fundamentally one of the right to choose how one experiences this world as a mature human being and how to respect the right of your fellow humans' desire to do the same, regardless of some fear-based hypothesis about how that might negatively impact your circle or how one might choose one substance instead of another to be acceptable for consumption, while another substance is still available and yet offers a situation to exercise tyranny of the everpresent threat of incarceration for the crime of exploring an altered state of consciousness. Now I beg of you to lay your offers aside for just a momemt and imagine the impact of the illegality and the constant fear and that of punishment for a state of relief; which, if sought through alcohol or a prescription, is perfectly fine. Yet, should you seek to explore states of consciousness that aren't in the &quot;list&quot; you get to experience that with the added flavor of fear.</div><div><br/></div><div>Look, I know wjat in saying it's going to be a jump for most people and I really understand the value of your time. I am going to ask you to honestly set aside what you think you know about drugs and try on a different way of thinking for just a few minutes, or honestly,  don't even bother to continue reading.</div><div>honesly. do you think that addicts would be stealing and sneaking around and lying if there was no threat of incarceration attached to the discovery of their habits? I mean people would of course go through addiction just like they do with alcohol or gambling or sex or any number of other behaviors which don't get you arrested if you happen to admit that you are doing them. </div><div>Imagine if you didn't have to acquire your medicine through illegal avenues or begin to associate with criminals in order to socially experience this? What unknowable impact can you imagine that this community has on each other? Can you honestly say you don't think that it would matter? of course I'm intentionally avoiding mentioning specific substances because I want you to actually hear the rhetoric in your thoughts as you keep reading into what I'm writing. how many times in the course of reading this have you scoffed and refused to consider the idea that prohibition is the biggest problem. prohobition creates the opportunity for a culture of criminality by offering a way of finding crime through providing servicrs or products runway many adult humans seek and in many cases use responsibly if you can factor out the ilegality of acquisition and avoiding detection of use. just the act of removing the  taboo nayure of it would diminish the appeal for many people. now i can hear you going straught to the most OBVIOUSLY HORRIFFIC of all substances which you can think of to disprove my theory. I mean EVERYBODY KNOWS that certain drugs are just nothing butvdestructive and instantlyvaddictive from the moment they are experienced. right? of course. you would cut the world off from the benefits of Cannabinoids or Psychedelics using Heroin or Amphetamine as your benchmark. do you think that is appropriate? do you have an experience with these substances? have you been given Morphine, Codeine, Hydrocodone, Oxycodone, Adderal or Desoxyn? these are drugs which have been found to be useful by the FDA for the treatment of common ailments from simple pain management to attention deficit d** to narcolepsy and obesity. in fact a larger number of children than i feel comfortable with are on regulsr doses (though small) of time-release Amphetamine that goes by the name of Adderall. if you have ever abised this drug bybtaking more than the actual dosage you are prescribed then you have had a nearly identical experience asca beggining Meth user orca very experienced one actually  someone with a high tolerance experiences less of a change in dispisition from smokin meth as you didcfrom your first few times you drank coffee. especially modern coffee. my first cup of coffee was a scoop of folgers in 1988 while I was doing a term paper. mybrecollection of that was a buzz stronger than almost all of my experiences with  meth. including iv usage. I'm being very honest about that. if i changed the files tomorrow sick that posession of enough coffee to get you through half a day carried a 5 year sentence, youd probably condider that to be a little inappropriate. No I don't want to put words in your mouth but what I think you're about to say to me is that coffee never landed someone in rehab or stealing from their parents or made them take up a life as a dealer and i ask you to look at coffee again with fresh eyes. barristas, entire countries are supported in the commerce from coffee, and I know it's funny or fashionable to joke about what one might do without ones coffee, first thing in the morning  or how hard or wax to stop drinking coffee, or the effects of caffeine withdrawal... headaches, sleeplessness, depression, gastrointestinal consequences... </div><div><br/></div><div>now, what if coffee were illegal, and you know it's pretty harmless, I mean it helps me do the taxes, or stay awake when I'm driving a long way, it's harmless right? but the thing is, it's kind of euohoric and I can't make it at home because the neighbors would smell it and call the cops cause they already dont like that I stay up listening to music sipping coffee quietly with the doors closed, stereo up Jay to msk the sounds of the percolator. </div><div><br/></div><div>and when i go to that person's house who sells it to me, it smells so nice in there and the grinder looks so cool and they are so mysterious and confident, these rebels, i mean there are guns there and other people, into otjer crazy things like smoking cigarettes which, i have to admit really good great with coffee.. and I used to be into the sumatran roast but lately ive been getting into this columbian stuff, its like the first time. </div><div><br/></div><div>and I don't want my parents to find out, or my husband, of my good what would they think? they might have me arrested, did you hear about mrs johnson called the police on her own husband because he she found his grinder in the garage? </div><div><br/></div><div>and the smith's kid crashed his car twice last month and the found coffee between the seats! </div><div><br/></div><div>anyway I could put a lot of energy and creativity into this, and I may get but suffice to ask you this : is it possible that your experience with the perception of the social impact of the substance isn't largely due to it's illegality and the culture of criminality that is required for its use, which i believe is due to a demand which is inevitable? except for Overdose, heroin doesn't have any significant, long term biological effects, likewise the prevailing cause of damage from amphetamine use is from sleep deprivation according to the dictorscwho tend to prescribe it. </div><div>i may have returned too soon to our present perveption. i might have made too quick a turn for some folks and I'm sure that for many peeps nonturn would be slow enough to keep you in this path in trying to walk down. this hypothetical meandering which is just as unproven as prohibition. oh wait. we have a long term case study in prohibition and its resukts. now im about to lose a bunch of you becausecwhat im saying is harsh, and yoi are probably already aware of what's im going but the facts are right here in our present situation. prohobition has resulted in our current situation AT BEST. much worse is the hidden impact of prohibition which is the enabling of an infrastructure which offers incredible profits to a social network of peoole who supportvactivities much more corrosivecand sinister than escaping reality. the unspoken impact of prohibition is the prevalence of highly efficient, evasion resistant, smoothly working and cobstantly evolving criminal infrastructure which harbors enables and even elevates groups of individuals who have no boundaroes when it comes to their goals, people who support each other and expose each other to a system of education and even the penal system reinforces and in many cases validates the status and reputation of a network that undermines the fundamental philosophy of this country. im sure you can imagine from your own experience more detailed examples of this. </div><div>additionally, and here's what it goes you tube conspiracy theory and I'm just going to be some look who is jumping at shadows but i am far more worriedcabout publishing this because of the guys I havecmet than the lawcenforcement community. I mean where do you think this money goes? and it is a LOT of money. prohibition is GOOD BUSINESS I mean, I perform for billionaires, i rub elbows with some very wealthy people and well, heres where even I shut my mouth.  </div><div>big money inevitably flows to one place. to the nation state and its &quot;custodians&quot; and as longvas investigators are chasing their fails at the street and county levels, the significantly less resources there are to keep an eye on the criminals who really impact the shape of our society. all funded or mostly funded by the granting of the illicit little wishes of the 300 million drug users in this country. to get in your little space capsule and move freely around this island and get your fix of whatever takes the edge off, controlled and profligately profited by the silent structure which really runs the show; and mathematically this would indicate that anyone who has significant power sits perchedcatop a platform which must be partially supported by this architecture, no flimsy scaffold but a brick and mortar parthenon, almost proudly flexing just under the white robes wefind it easier to bevdeceived as long as they make an effort to keep the robes mostly clean. </div></span>
