<span><div>I want to explain something to you. and it's going to be a big wow at the end, but ti's going to ake a minute for me to set it up and it starts with a number.</div><div><br/></div><div>but, it's the biggest number you can actually be present to.</div><div><br/></div><div>I mean you take a number, like the biggest one ever, the biggest one you can possibly  perceive, you know; except I'm willing to bet that it isn't as big as you think it is</div><div> </div><div>so l;et's start at the bottom let's start with Zero</div><div>like well I guess we can't really understand the infinite nature of nothing, of a real zero, I mean you are something and I am something and I can prove that I exist because I'm the only one that needs to prove it and I'm the one imagining that it must be proven and so there you go. You can't convince me otherwise because I'm not even sure that you exist.</div><div> </div><div>There's a conundrum there.  If I can imagine nothing, then it must exist but well, it's nothing and so that would mean for it to exist, then we coiuld not so nothing cannot exist otherwise, it wouldn't have been thought of.</div><div><br/></div><div>but in between the smallest measure of time, that planck there is an interesting concept, a state of completely solid mass with infinite stillness and impenetrable solidity and then short period of time when everything is moving from one time/space to the next and there fore there is nothing anywhere because it's all in transit, teleporting to the next buckyball over.Well, that's the prevailing scientific theory l anyway, it makes sense to me so I'll let that go and simply state that I cannot comprehend zero.</div><div><br/></div><div>so then we can kind of skip the fractions and state that we kind oif understand oine, cause it's like we are one but then again we're made up of a gazillion parts and they're all moving and most of this we really aren't in charge of and couldn't start or stop it if we tried , REALLY HARD, which is good cause we'd all come apart and get mixed up and I for one would not only be completely disorganized but probably late to everything as well so I'd like to think I can conceptualize ONE but when I think abut it II can't really remmebr thinking that I iwas ever really ALONE, like I might look at myuself as lonely and then think, well I mean there are people out there I'm just a little busy at the moment figuring out the universe and where my left my keys; meanwhile I'm holding them in the other hand... besides, most of the times I've interacted with those other beings the result was questionable and scary and I'm not even sure it was worth it.  did you ever get to thinking like that.  I do, I mean I like people generally but then again, most of us are fuckign crazy.and you know the ones that really catch my attention are like gods or something and I can hardly bear to return their eyes without turning all red and sweating all over the place, </div><div><br/></div><div>Yes I'm doing that on purpose. Yes I've been in love; but you know, so many times have I been in love or in a deep friendship when out of nowhere ( or so I think) something changes you know because things change, we say that, it just changes and in the space of a planck, shit, who are you people anyway?  the building blocks that make us up just completely change positions  about 17, billion trillion times  in the space of a heart beat. G AND THEN EVERY OTHER TIME i&quot;VE EVER FELT THAT IN MY LIFE IT  DIDN'T </div><div>ITURN OUT OR THERE WAS BETRAYAL OR THEREE WAS SOPMEPON TAKING SOMETHING FROM ME A-  OR THERE WAS SPOME4ONE ASKING ME TO COMPROMISE AND FEEL LEWSS THAN i DID WHEN THERE WAS ANORTHER WITH ME,  AND SOP i GUES i CAN'T REALLY BE THINKI9NG OF two if I'm always be3 waiting for the other show to drop so I can not reallly say with an y certainty that I really know what two of a thing is like, I mean I get the concept of a pair, hell I get the cvoncept of a wild swinging caligula style orgy with all sorts of combinations but you se there I go again, deflecting in a way</div><div>whioch byt he wayt IU amn not saying is wrong. ser9iouslyu, what I am not talking about here to da7y is about wrong or4 forght or my idea of it a or your idea of it cause that's all bulshit if uyou ask mwe</div><div>but where I was going with this is that it's not fair. and I know it'</div><div>s not fair because mathin isn't fair an the iuniverse isn't dair, the playing field is not leel excpet saythat it's not level foprt anyone so it's lkind opf fgait nut npot terally</div><div><br/></div><div> zj v;eoit's not fair that I can't type as fast Awe I think fuck man that rallyp kills me,l. I mena the keys can't physically 'go up and down that fast so  I have to sllooew it fd=own uinto this rhythym where my thoughts don'tget too far past my 5typing., like a song,. oike pioerty  you have to see if you can dig the way they come out of you r mouth ..not just what you're saying but you gopt a fugure out hoow to hold hte thouyght for long enough to put it into language and man that's a igh thing to do s=becuias eeyou can be on the greatest thought and whiulke you're sppending time making it rhyme yuou kmiught lose it and be to concerned with the sound of the turn f the words and then what you thopught you were thinkgin it was reaslly just something you heard,.</div><div><br/></div><div>hat's th onley wauy I can bair the infinte unfairness of fairness and nothing, crazy when you trry to put it in to qrods biut you have to thing for infinity, I mean inifity can expost becauise infity is actually nonexixtance  in order from something to be defined, you have to have something whcih you can relate to, something to relate it to, something ithat is like it and somehting that is not like it, and you see existence, has a definition in that something is as opposed to something that isn't but if you can imagine a thing then it's like it is, but at the sam time it isn't which is where olsd whatshis name was going with the whole I think thewrefore I aml. I mean someo opf you folks really don't get the enormity of that statement because you have mnever REALLY ASked your selof about the defining l3construct of that stateent, because for it o be true than it's opposite muwt also be true, hell even if it's false, there has to be sojmething trhere,.l  so sos  what are you ifr you donlt thing... nothing? maqybe but yuou cannot not thing, right, I mean le3t's go tot the absiolutes of definitions and yyou thing I think we all thing but whocame uip with the idea of thought? I mean, I'm not talking about 10,0-00 10,0000000000000000 years ago, I'm talking about in your known lifetime in this physicval realm..  who came up with that idea?  we are hunmanh, we are a coillectinve consciousness that apparently began some 10 to 14 billion years agoi which might as well be infinity for all you and IU are concerned because it's not fair, fugheddaboutit.,  right like  WTF?   there is a one and a zero  a question mark and an exclamation point,m   hel I never understood 2why they didn't use the question mark dfor the 0  I mean ZZERO is soiled, it's rouind it's complete, it's DEFINITE.  and a one well I mean that's it right you go from complete to incoomplete in the space form 1 to 0 or from 0 to one,     rabbit hoolwe</div><div><br/></div><div>anyway what I was saying is that it's not fair4,, you take the biggest fucking number you can possibly wrap your head around and Oi'm willing to argue that it's less than one but let's say you cold reall really really wrappyour heasd around a number like how may7 seconds you ahve lived so far .. right so if yo're around let's sayt 80- years old  we're talkling about </div><div>do we have anyone here who is 100  no I didn't thing so I mena it's a nice round fuicking number and we like thatbut I'd like you to think about 100 days ago I was it was over three monjths, more than a third of a year, a little more than a season. 100 days, don't like that number loets go in 3s , lets say 90 days, I mean do we have any 90 year olds in the audience tonight? no do any onf you REALLY KNOW A 90 year old welolk, I mean well, not like your mom or your dayd causeyou don't know thme,k you just thiunk you do,</div><div><br/></div><div>anyway, 90 days ago, something happenenedd, can you wrap your heald qarounf that</div><div><br/></div><div>pther exampoless 990 ytears, 980 then fo to 90 minites  they were just getting out of the car, finding their seats, maybe 90 minutes ago the couple said I DO</div><div>does everyone reember that?&gt;  when they sauid  I do.,  big moment,  yes we know , that was 90 minutes ago. 1,5 hours</div><div><br/></div><div>now dpo you think you could try and get present to tthe biggest number you could possibly fathon andyou can only fathom what you'fve experienhc ed so let's say , the number of days in your life  shouldn't be too hard it'snot like I&quot;m asking you to get present to a plancks or something</div><div><br/></div><div>let's say the average gin i here is 25, haha, I like to think i appeal to that cvrowd,,,  haha no I don't haha juist kidding,k I might have at one point but you knoe anywah</div><div><br/></div><div>next,  let's go fifty, halfd a century cause iff you'r5e diggin what I'm laying down you're an old soul bably and your minuites mena more,., haha just kidding actually they mean less,</div><div>butok so in a a year there are 365 and a 1/4 days all these numbers are r3eally arbitrary anyway because it's just the coincidence of saome balls spinning around  and we' as a species have only been here such a short time that we can't even determine a time when the velocity or the location of these balls was discernably different,  opk hiubble, I'm not talkingt you yuou</div><div>[but realy, we are insignificant. and that nuber of days in a year multioplied by 50 is roughly half orf 36525 which, rounding down for the sake of insignifigance is around 18262 that doesn't seem right does it  18000 days is all I have lived, I mean not really evey ten years is about 3652.5 days doesn't seem like much at all, ok so let's look at hours,  or maybe waking hours , if you forget that little 1/4 day you know do you know how muych that means in fifty years/  well it would be half of a quarter gith bcauise a 1qarter day times one hunder years would be 25 days and then you lf that 12.5 you know I&quot;m hopingyou're p[icking up theres t3exc21ungqwues for mathin if nothign else.</div><div><br/></div><div>yes in 50 years if you factored out that that 1/4 day of earth's orbit vs it's spins,  yes you could take almost but not quite mind you, two weeks vacation.</div><div><br/></div><div>UI don't know about uyou but I'm oissing a lot more time thatnh that.</div><div><br/></div><div>3let's get back to that, </div><div>right now, that is to say back them, cause time is a unstoppable and powerful stream that we are flowing in,  don't let it bother yuou that we are ruching along at 3000 some miles an hour in orbit relatinve to the sun whcih itslef if crusing along at a hell I don't even know that  number</div><div><br/></div><div>but wnayway, that nuimber isn't big enou let';s go tpo secoinds.,....  how many hours are in that i18262 days? 438,300  now we're talking , I mean , that's a number, the anout of hours I've been on this earth. wow3, but I mean is it a bug number reallly  in hours that almost 2 week vacation isw 300 hours,,,l, not a lot of time is it.,</div><div><br/></div><div>]but then again we know that time is relative  if I stated these times or distances in relation to all that I am possibly congnizant of, it would stand to reason that My intrinsic perception of an hour is shorter than say a baby's I mean to say that if I have been alive for 438K hours and a baby hahas been alove for 8766 hours, then you could say that an hour is one 438kth of my experience and as such is not a veryu long amount of time</div><div>and a baby's hour is one 8766th of it's totalk experivnce so far and akthouh  that is 50 times larger than my concept of an hour.  imagine if you said to me, david, I'll giive you until you can finish eating this peach until it's time to go home aqnd you said, well, I'll take my time, you know cause I don't want to go just yet and I'd like to enjoiy my peach,,,   hmmm.  and then you pulled out a peach that was the size of ups truck.... then you said, hurry up!  you see I'm thinking I have a really long time, in fact I can get all sorts of thing sdome with that peach,,,l it's fifty time larger than a &quot;mnormal&quot; peach to me.</div><div><br/></div><div>yes well,. how many seconds</div><div> </div><div>how many namo seconds?</div><div><br/></div><div>these are just the increments of a human ife </div><div><br/></div><div>now you say in yo r ideation you might thing that as we talk about these numbers in he millions and billions  and trillions and oh shit now we're running into the debt   ,...  and you know this is how i know the workld the universe is not dfair...</div><div>that insame number that we reall are stretcvhing to conceptualize and become present to..</div><div><br/></div><div>well it's no use so let's bouble it, let's square it@ times that number by itse; idf it was the size of a postage stamp, not it's the size of a rubiuk's cuuibe</div><div><br/></div><div>now take that number that impossiubly large cube.,.. and hold it,. now</div><div>do you know the difference between that number and infinity? the space between that huge number and iunfiity</div><div>is infinity! incomrehensible. and I have wasted roughlky 75 milli billion nanoseconds of your time trying to get you to realize how unfairly small we are, our entire individuyal exiostence, out entire species, life as we know it is just a blink, a wink, and we are here against all odds  I mean an extraqordinarily time porobablitly that we even get here at all,  and I'm not about to get all moral with you about species that are no longer with us because the UNIVERSE&lt; infinity is cruel as curekl can be, infinity kills all,  KALI God Krishna,m Yahweh, whatver your concept it is my favorite q1uoteof them all, in a text as old as histlry</div><div>he says, &quot;Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds&quot;</div><div>and what he meant was TIME, which nothing survives. not even nothing wsurviuves timel</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>and it'snot dfair you say, dave that's not fair,. it's not fair and yopr'</div><div>e right no it's not fair becaise there is nho fair, just like there is not time and thier is no distance and there is no spacve but only in relation to we, us sentient beings experience ing this vast unfathomable span of space and time whcih,k in relation to everything,k is smalle4r than nothing. and even nothing cannot survive time, </div><div>not even nothing can survive time, because nothing cannot be itself if there is sojmethigng but since that dowsn't last, then the conundrum of NOTHING is realized in that ist is and cannot be at the smae time</div><div><br/></div><div>I fint it interesting that this limitless, infinite &quot;thing&quot; let's call it is something that we view as limited, for a limited time, for a short time, time is running out, listen man, time hasn;'t ven gotten started, I mean in f time was rtunning amarathon, right now time hasn't even bout the shoes you know what I mean?</div><div><br/></div><div>and as muich as I hate to say it, and as much as it is and asn't true, I'm just about out of time and I won't take any more of yours except to say this, you boith have and you haven't got, time. thank you for listenintg</div><div><br/></div><div>now wait a minute.</div><div>do you think it's weird that we talk about time as a l;ocation.l like at that time at at where in time?  it wasn't then,   I haven't got time, I have tiome do you have time, where has all the tiome gone? when am I ghetting out of here  what time zonew are you in  </div><div><br/></div><div>ah well I'm in alpha centauri meridian but my species goes by nebula glow savings time </div><div><br/></div><div>what other condistions of eficiendcy as a result of environmental constraints or vagaries can 2we define, like let's say jet stream, you can only fly when the wind is a certain speed so you  change your schedule to</div><div><br/></div><div>ikjet stream savings time</div><div> constraints of dDST are money, our eyes needing light , the daylighyt  the rotation of the sun, your relation to the equator, cause  of both ambient light and tempreature, climate constarinats, energy, food scacity.,  but then again it can all be explained in ratios, lie s resource is abundant or scarce and is either getting scarcer or getting more abundant or is constant but limited so if something is constant it is intereting to not that it is either scarce or abundant, or too much or too liottle depending y- on your relation to it as far as needs etsc  EFVERYTHING IS LIE THIS'</div><div><br/></div><div>scarcity abuyndance and economy is the leveraging of what you have for the echange of what you need,. and need and want are identical in this construct</div><div><br/></div><div>and time has you, you don'thave time. time is just our way to make sense of what hapenend and to guess what';s going to happen and to either make sure we're there or make sure we aren't there when it happens again.</div><div><br/></div></span>
