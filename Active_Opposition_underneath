It's often a slight change in the way you notice interactions between humans of differing personalities that reveal the intricacies of development in creativity and science. A situation that could explain why some great creatives' or scientists' work doesn't become popular until long after the discoverer is gone; because of the nature of the revelation of Truth. If there is Truth to be found and it hasn't been pointed out at that time or place; it seems to me that there was something that was pervasive; yet, actively ignored, dynamically used (in part but not in toto); or hidden/manipulated for control by an establishment to sustain power or control; like, a secret technology, esoteric information or a patented/misunderstood device).

Truth is difficult to accept when it is revealed, in this case, to many people... like technology, misbelieved or feared; and, living opposition can develop dynamically, hidden around the writer or scientist. Not knowing this, since that kind of thing is usually very alien to a creative's nature, it is possible that they remain confounded for many many years; their personality the generator of the curiosity, their excitement the impetus for the sharing; also the obstacle for general acceptance of the discovery.

Personally, I fucking hate people that get in the way of a creative mind. It places in my mind the image of a young girl, bringing home her watercolor from school to have to knocked out of her hand and stomped on by some jackass who is afraid of the color pink. Fuck You, one of these days, I'm gonna see that shit happen and I'm going to suffocate you with a fucking fluffy flamingo and I'm gonna let David Patrone yell ironic impossibilities in your ear as you die.
