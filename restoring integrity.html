<div><span><div>my use of the term &quot;Integrity&quot; in regards to myself generally requires the modifier &quot;lacking&quot; in front of it. Contrary to my own opinion this was not taught to me at Parris Island but by an organization called &quot;Landmark,&quot; and after that work, I looked back and realized that the Marine Corps also looks at integrity this way; only, I had been confusing morality as being a part of integrity and I think that many young Marines of my era did this as well. if you haven't been to Landmark, I not only recommend that you go because I care that more people learn that work; but, I don't have enough of your attention to give you this idea of integrity here, it requires a couple of months if not years of your time and all of your attention to really understand the significance of Integrity as a human trait.</div><div>in the interest of expediency i present this humorous anecdote:</div><div>The Integrity of a Hotel Refrigerator. </div><div>for instance might help me explain a tiny bit of what the word might mean to you if you could  fathom the word's totality.</div><div>first you must ask, and be able to answer this question. Do you have much experience with hotel refrigerator? and then, you expect a hotel room's refrigerator to do what? For instance, would you trust your open box of pork lo mein to be edible a week later, having been kept in your hotel room refrigerator for the whole time? Do you expect that your hotel room refrigerator (HRF) would keep your food separate from your stale laundry? do you expect your HRF to keep your ice ceeam frozen, or soft or maybe just from having to repurpose said laundry ironically as cleaning supplies? Or does your HRF keep your ice cream from freezing your room? does your hotel room refridgerator's compressor keep you from sleeping; or does it help you to enjoy the adult selections on your hotel tv since you weren't planning on sleeping anyway? or do you have a neighbor's refridgerator for that vicarious purpose? Does your HRF hold the microwave at a more convenient elevation than the floor, which;  by the way, while often inconvenient, has probably the most Integrity of all at holding things but not the best integrity at catching delicate things safely.</div><div>and</div><div>ahhh¡ you said, &quot;Eureka! That apostrophe engages my attention much more effectively; but, with questionable integrity as a pure instrument of communication.&quot;</div><div>I hope, by making those two jumps, I have somehow avoided for you the annoying list of uses for a hotel room refrigerator which have hardly anything to do with refrigeration and everything to do with imagination, thus assisting in the integrity of this piece of writing; while also hoping that the humor hasn't detracted from the essence of what a hotel refridgerator can be counted upon to do, which,  in my estimation is roughly:</div><div>1. to not heat something on the inside and </div><div>2. to provide a relatively flat surface that magnets stick to on three sides, (should you have any in your possession while traveling. </div><div>(Sometimes an HRF will even provide enough noise to periodically mask a growling stomach.)</div><div>However</div><div>One should also consider Environment. How about a hotel room refridgerator in a third-world roadside motel in a tropical clime? How about an arctic one? how about the esteemed Samsung at Waldorf Astoria Honolulu? One might reasonably have different expectations from these three things; which, in reality are supposed to provide the exact same service and physical capabilities. I personally don't even know if there is a Waldorf Astoria Honolulu or if Samsung makes tiny refrigerators. (The author would like the reader to know that he is in a Travelodge in Platte City Kansas and that the Admiral refridgerator located in his room has Integrity.)  You could say lots of Integrity or superb Integrity accept that that's not how Integrity works, That would be integrity lacking itself and here I should stop the loop. Integrity is neither moral nor immoral.  Meaning something that lacks integrity is not immoral for its lack of integrity. in fact, one could say that a dedicated crook who couldn't commit a crime lacked Integrity and possessed Morality. I promise to stop before i get to practicing politicians. </div><div>It either an HRF does what it says it's going to do and does it...  well, it doesn't matter whether it does it well or not, it has a standard, it complies with said standard and it has integrity otherwise it has integrity as a table or a paperweight under the right wind conditions. long or short.</div><div>Enough about the Integrity or lack of Integrity of the hotel room refrigerator or my acronyms, what we're talking here about is humans. At least that's what I think I'm talking about pretty much all the time, no matter the wing conditions, left or right.</div><div>So I was asked,  &quot;what does that mean for a human then, to have&quot;integrity&quot; and that is why it takes a very long time to grasp its meaning because a human can tell you many things about itself or others and can even wear clever t-shirts and stickers to describe its capabilities, even give you reasonable expectations; ad caveat emptor, for culpability goes to the person who has expectations of the integrity of another. You are the one who applies your own principles to someone else's Behavior, ostensibly to determine whether or not they deserve your praise or disdain or if their words carry water or just get everyone wet. maybe your trust is in their inability to meet your predetermined principles. We could go on and on and on but that wouldn't help you grasp the idea of Integrity, you have to go through the training yourself.</div><div>And if you &quot;get it&quot; then maybe you can explain it better than I, this next part of this article which is about asking the the following  question:</div><div>&quot;how does one restore integrity?&quot;</div><div>Achieving Integrity as an actualized Human Being is impossible enough; like Trust, or vanilla ice cream very difficult to restore once you have polluted it with something else. </div><div>It's very difficult to keep calling something vanilla ice cream once you dropped a few chocolate chips into it, or even 1 drop of anything not vanillaesque. </div><div>it's also Interesting to me that you could mix in a drop of something poisonous into vanilla ice cream and still call it vanilla ice cream and yet one drop of chocolate syrup changes it completely. especially to someone who can't stand chocolate.</div><div>&quot;Sir,  would you like to vanilla ice cream with a little bit of nicotine in it or caffeine maybe or will you take a scoop of the vanilla ice cream which sat next to the chocolate syrup?&quot; </div><div>And so many things just happened right there.</div><div>You should probably take a few minutes to think about them; because that's what I'm going to do right now.</div><div>right? me neither.</div><div>indulge me this moment to apologize if this seems to be an endorsement of Landmark. it is not, except that I cannot present a progression without giving its owner credit.  I will say that what was most powerful to me, at least thus far, was that the first segment revealed to me how important it is to define the distinctions between things that I didn't realize I blurred together like integrity and morality. and they taught it to me the best way possible by pointing out where those two things did and did not exist within me. to say that i resisted their assertions would be like saying &quot;polar bear swim club&quot; is like a refreshing dip.</div><div><br/></div><div>And for all of you folks that have gone to Landmark and left before the completion of the first three &quot;courses&quot; otherwise known as &quot;The Work&quot; or strongly disagree with their approach, for you I will specifically avoid saying &quot;I get that&quot; because I almost had the same experience; but, the cost of the first seminar as a ratio to my income was far enough over 1 that even my indignation was not sufficient to get me to leave the room; and  due to a serendipitous intervention after deciding that disruption was an inappropriate level of revenge, I remained silent enough to experience a shift within, similar to what Mr. Gladwell describes in, &quot;The Tipping Point&quot; only with more of a spiritual rather than commercial result. My indignation missed an opportunity on that afternoon, and my indignation has probably been the most costly trait to maintain in this life (and probably all others) and is as strong as ever regardless of this knowledge.</div><div><br/></div><div>I consider Landmark to be sort of like advertising for the small business entrepreneur in that you can never do enough of it or spend enough money on it and it will continue to provide some, although diminishing amount of ROI after its initial explosion of value and otherwise unobtainable denoument (keep in mind that I only use words like denoument to ensure that you have to grab a dictionary from somewhere). For me, a 40ish year old single non-father between careers, it was daunting enough, I cant imagine how hard it must have been for others to accept. After that, the point the Value of Landmark seemed to be attaxhed to its social structure which increases on a personal level because you can become someone who can help new people coming in and that's a Value that's really difficult to quantify outside of your own head; and just like advertising, can cost all available time and every dollar you have.  The question is &quot;what is the value to you?&quot; For me it required a level of integrity I was unwilling to maintain for a variety of reasons that had less to do with landmark and more to do with personal accountability, otherwise known elsewhere as addiction, and I left during a relapse.  It would be inauthentic of me to let you assume either caused the other. Like Integrity and Morality, causality and culpability are independent and learning  that distinction has cost me several of my own lives.</div><div>For anyone who has not done the first work, I recommend it and for anyone who left before they completed it I recommend that you go back, keep in mind this is being said by the man who has yet to complete it himself. For anyone who is interested in learning the second work, i would tell you that it's not worth it except that I wont bother because we both know you won't listen. I sometimes wonder and havent asked how long it took my father to realize that he could teach lessons he'd painfully learned to his second and third sons. That was as clumsily worded as it was lived. I cant imagine how hard that was Pops. </div><div><br/></div><div>I wish there were long enough moments of silence for parents of kids like me. Who never stole a thing except access to their son.</div><div><br/></div><div>Now,  lets get back to the ice cream and how to restore vanilla. i think you have to start by calling it something else, like Prince did, in two directions,  and in reference to its forner self, like vanilla with accidental chocolate, the amalgum formerly located next to the pistachio. Which for some might be like &quot;cloudy with a chance of cyclone.&quot; and considering the geographical location I'm writing from could be considered bad form. Whether or not I currently share Dorothy's sentiment.</div><div>other methods might require a complete replacement of all ingredients, dishes, plates, menues, spoons. </div><div>It occurred to me today, while in a really interesting Antique Mall, that I didn't know the number of times, or methods I would have to emoloy to cleanse an antique bottle which had been molded with the word &quot;poison&quot; in it, before I would ironically repurpose it for something ingestible.</div><div>Would anyone having not read this even crashed for the gravity of that joke while going through my medicine cabinet?</div><div>In case you're wondering, the items in the mall just west of Plarte City were antiques, not the mall itself, which gave the place a very interesting contrast. I could have (and probably will) spend many many more days of this short life, in that place. which brings into question the value of a day and the length of time and effort which restoring one's integrity might require.</div><div>Which also brings into question the condition of the integrity prior to it having Gone Missing. </div><div>Which I have to remind myself really doesn't matter because there is no condition to Integrity. The question then becomes what is it you have said you will do. Have you placed the condition of time on your Word?  </div><div>The point at which you lose your integrity I suppose is the point in when you've decided you've given up. Because failure only exists if you've given up. Unless there's a &quot;deadline&quot;  which is an interesting pair of words to compound in reference to a thing like integrity. Of course there's the condition of progress, kind of a milquetoast way of avoiding Integrity but sounds nice, a euphemism; but,  now I'm being cynical and &quot;excessively vocabularistic.&quot;  </div><div>Maybe one day I'll see that in the manual with &quot;NONSTANDARD&quot; next to its proper term like irregardless has.</div><div>I hope the custodians of the integrity of Mr Webster  and Messrs. Merriam enjoyed that last bit i did not write this in an effort to diminush the importance of utilizing their exceptional and free service at <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com">www.merriam-webster.com</a> </div><div>To a Mr. Gladwell who certainly never asked for or needed my opinion: That is how I would do Marketing, by restoring Integrity which I might possess had I finished your books.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></span>
