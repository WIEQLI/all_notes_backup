It is going only to you.  It is not going to be pleasant but it could avoid a lawsuit which will most certainly involve both you and the YMCA and all of the following items to be considered. I am so disappointed at your email. I haven't been this sorry i cut a client a break in a really long time. as such, you may find the tone to be strong, rest assured that I feel this way and if you feel insulted I'm sorry. I too feel quite insulted</span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><br/></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">Not only do I consider it criminal, this &quot;arrangement&quot; to not issue payment for a contract which was fulfilled, (except for the part which was discussed with Sidd);</span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">not only that; then you avoid contact with me for almost a week, in which I am forced to contact you twice, during this time you had some discussion with the client which included the calculation of man-hours in the delivery of a Musical Ensemble. I am also to understand that during this conversation you advised them them to withhold payment for a contract which was not only fulfilled; but complimented for by you, by Sidd, Fredy et. al.and tipped, personally, by you. They told me that you had tipped them $100 each, which becomes confusing later.. I wasn't made aware of any disappointment of service; in fact you personally tipped most of the musicians, until you realized you didn't have enough money to tip the rest, at which time you did one of the most crass things I have ever seen, strange too that the first musicians you tipped were the ones you are now complaining about and still told me what a great night you thought it was.</span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><br/></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">I wasn't even going to reply to your email, I was just going to have my lawyer sue both you and the YMCA; but, as a courtesy and gesture of good faith to avoid a lawsuit, I'll give you my perspective, and you can decide if it's prudent to continue to encourage your client to hold payment for a contract which was fulfilled and tipped for personally by you at the end of the night. By all agreed points this is a fulfilled contract with the verbal discussion with Sidd for changes. Legally you can't withhold payment for any of these reasons. Technically I should be charging penalties at this point because my contract specifies that I require payment on the date of the contract. Judging from your email there was never a check cut on that date so it looks like they never intended to honor the contract.That is not good, especially in lieu of how hard it was to get them to get the contract in place.</span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><br/></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">if I am not paid the full amount I will ask the Musicians Union to join me in bringing suit against both you and the YMCA. I'm sure that you and the YMCA have great lawyers, I'm also sure that this amount of money means nest to nothing for you in comparison to the financial positions of these musicians and myself; and the rest of this letter will be dedicated to why I believe, in lieu of easily verifiable facts and testimony, we will prevail and most likely be awarded an additional amount for your decision to intentionally withhold payment without so much as a word to me. I think I can show that you were actually planning on waiting it out. From the beginning you delayed the contract, you failed to turn in documents, forced me to acquire irrelevant documentation, you failed to read these documents including my contract until I urged you to. Even at my urging you took the deposit so casually, I had to repeatedly ask for the contract and deposit and finally make it clear that I would not hire musicians until I had a signed contract and a deposit, which took you FOUR MONTHS to get to me. I have records of these emails and my concerns are very clear in them.</span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><br/></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">Here are a few other reasons why I think you have no cause. Again, I'm giving you the courtesy of reading this before I turn it over to my lawyer to send to the YMCA. I'll ask him if I should also send this to the other vendors who were present at the event after I have come to the conclusion that you are OK with misrepresenting the events of that night; why wouldn't you also besmirch my character to the other vendors?</span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><br/></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">It is possible that your intoxication level, which was clearly visible, is the reason why you may have forgotten that you personally tipped the two horn players outside $100 each, then later tipped the singer and after realizing you didn't have enough cash to give equal amounts to the rest of the band, you handed me a few hundred dollar bills and said, &quot;I want this to go to you, just pay them out of the rest&quot; I couldn't believe that you would do such a thing, in front of the female vocalist who you had just handed a $100 bill. Even what you handed me wasn't enough to pay the band equally. So, to let you know, I gave that money to the guys, it was short $100 so I told the last guy that I would personally cover it when I was paid and that I would get them checks when I got one from you. I cannot believe youhave the audacity to suggest that I would have kept that money and not given it to my band. How Horribly rude of you. How sickening it was to watch you, drunk, encourage me to stiff my band in front of them; and now, to dare accuse me of something like this. The only money they haven't been paid is the check I should have gotten that night according to the contract.</span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><br/></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">To top it off you were directing my performance, drunk, from the dance floor while some guy kept coming up to have me raffle off tickets from 3 different ticket rolls which had me announcing 8 number tickets in the middle of our show. Then, after I tried to make it a part of the show to make it entertaining you interrupt the bit while we are doing it</span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><br/></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">You personally tipped, in cash (the very musicians you are complaining about) without even telling me so your suggestion that somehow I kept the tips is at best, an attempt to threaten to defame my character, and I hope you understand how seriously I take that. After promising in several emails to tip the band members, you urged me to stiff two of the members and take the rest of the tip for myself because you were short, even if you hadn't tried to tip me you didn't bring enough to fulfil that promise. I discussed the musicians stopping the performance outside early with Sidd since I could not find you and he agreed that it would be OK to break them to entice the audience to come inside; later there was no audience to speak of outside and those musicians had come in to play with the inside band (which you are telling me didn't happen) AND your timing is not correct. The outside musicians did not go on their first break until around 9:30. I cleared it personally with Sidd since you were not able to be found.</span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><br/></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">Now, about your personal interaction with my musicians. Your behavior was totally inappropriate and you really should be expected to know better than to do what you did. My musicians were really upset. I don't know exactly what you said or did to upset them; but when I got to them after your first encounter they were ready to leave and I don't blame them. For future reference, when you hire entertainment, you should only bring your concerns to the bandleader or the person you hired to represent the band. You personally have a personality and leadership style which is probably exceptionally effective in your industry; but had two professional musicians ready to walk out. I had an excellent solution that took into account the acoustics of the building with the zones and the locations of the guests' music. You misinterpreted the &quot;playing together&quot; segment which was supposed to happen between the piano player outside and the band inside ONLY if the inside band volume was bleeding outside. This was your specific concern and how I addressed it with you in our meetings was with this solutions. We never agreed to the outside guys playing together, in fact you specifically wanted them to be separated so that you had different ambiances in the different locations. I tried to tell you how it would best work and you ignored the suggestions, you had an idea and you weren't' listening to any other suggestions. was by explaining that if the inside band was going to be that loud , that was the plan; which did not happen. What did happen is that you interrupted the musicians outside in such a manner that they were going to leave had I not gone and talked to them..</span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><br/></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">I was disappointed but not surprised because I had experienced the same feeling several times during meetings with you. You made two pro players so upset they were going to simply leave after talking to you. You were rude and you were clearly under the influence and the fact that you extracted information from them like some kind of interrogator should indicate what it must have been like to be spoken to by you. One of those guys is a Marine for God's sake!</span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><br/></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">Speaking of which, as far as your accusations derived from a forceful discussion you had with my musicians who didn't understand why you wanted them to do something that was not going to work in that space, while smelling of alcohol, they didn't even know who you were and why you came at them like that; but besides being totally unacceptable.behavior, you have no idea what were the circumstances surrounding why one of them was hired, not that day, by the way, but what I would consider the last minute. He was a sub because two of my guys that were hired had conflicts.</span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"> </span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">As an aside, how I hire, manage, compensate or reward musicians is a very complicated and dynamic structure which only becomes more complicated when I accept a contract for a third of my usual cost which I made clear I was doing because this was a fundraiser and in hopes that I might get something as simple as a few memberships for the guys in my band. I am not inclined to try to explain to you what is involved in hiring artists to work together especially for less than the usual pay. The repercussions of which will affect the band, even if they had gotten paid on time, which, they are now waiting on you to pay me to get the full part of the reduced amount.  I made it clear that this was considerably less compensation than we normally require and if you want to bill man hours, we can go back and include my hourly rate for all of the meetings you had me come to where I had to provide every single suggestion with a huge caveat designed to keep you from taking literally each general suggestion we put forth. It's like you hired a carpenter so you could pick up his tools and push him out of the way and punch holes in the wall. I got to endure that and more for the privilege of being paid a fraction of my rate and then to have the balance withheld. For the most part, my time and my presence was unnecessary wasted for the majority of the discussions, not to mention the parking and meetings at noon and 1 in balboa park which couldn't have been more inconvenient at peak tourist times; and the other meetings at your house in the evenings. Rewriting contracts, paying for insurance before I even had a contract from you. Writing contracts, rfaxing scanning emailing and repeating four times for miniscule changes. If you would like m to bill you for those hours I would be more than happy to. Those are peak times for me to for promoting, visiting and contacting potential clients. If you paid me for my time fairly you would have a much bigger bill on your hands.</span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><br/></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">You demonstrated to me a very clear lack of ability to handle dynamic changes, to interface with artists or to allow for a performance which was improvisational. You repeatedly tried to manage the dialogue without giving us either the talking points or the opportunity to develop it.  You asked for a service at a tremendously discounted rate and at the end of the night you were joyfully thanking me and tipping my musicians. I'd hate to be on your side of this discovery with lawyers in the room. On top of this you accuse me of cheating my musicians and suggest that I forfeit an amount of the contracted fee. How dare you treat someone like that? How long did you plan to wait to contact me after deciding between yourself and the client to withhold payment? What if I had not contacted you? What am I supposed to think? What would you do under the same circumstances in your company if someone treated you this way? How far would you go until you felt like you had been treated fairly? This amount of money might seem like throwaway money to you but I can assure you that neither I or my musicians can afford to work without compensation and delaying it is a pretty cruel approach if you ask me. That's how it looks to me. If you wanted to take recourse with me personally, holding payment for the rest of the band is not what I would consider to be the kind of action I would want my company to be known for. That will be discussed in court as well.</span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal;

color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 14px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><div>Hi David, </div><div>I have not heard back from Sidd yet. I did contact him after I heard from you on Sunday… There is some discussion about the contract not being fulfilled… to the level agreed upon. At the very least tho, each of your musicians received between $50 - $60 in cash from me… on the night of the event, provided you shared the cash tip I gave to you appropriately. </div><div><br/></div><div>I also gave the outside Keyboard and the Sax guys, $60 each, and both only played a total of an hour an a half… plus they had an hour break in between. Our contract was that they would play from 6:00 –11:00 and rotate into the inside band but that there would be outside music until 11:00 (with 10:00) being a possible wind down… Both told me they were only hired to play until 9:00. I tipped them early in hopes that they would stay, but they insisted they were told they could leave at 9:00… and the sax player told me he was only hired that afternoon. They left while people were still in the garden visiting at their tables and taking food.</div><div><br/></div><div>I also gave the singer, who was great, a $60 tip and I gave you $300, $50 each for the 4 stage band members and the balance for you..</div><div><br/></div><div>Additionally, we had to play music through the sound system, until after 6:30 when the keyboard finally got himself going, and the trombone began to warm up. The Sax player didn’t know where to go. At 6:45 he was still standing around in a corner and had a chip on his shoulder when I explained that he needed to be at the entrance in the courtyard… Concurrently, we had no roving harmonica… I could not find you anywhere in the courtyard or the garden. </div><div><br/></div><div>David, each time I had a planning session, I worked hard to keep you focused and on topic, and you assured me that you knew how to handle all these improvisational situations that we were creating… that you would be professional in every way. You did not follow through on any of the outside transitional pieces and you also did not prepare properly for the performance pieces inside… and all of the lateness was completely unprofessional… Those musicians leaving at 9:00, while they still had an audience and I had asked them to stay, was an outrage.</div><div><br/></div><div>I am very disappointed also.. I talked you up, gave you the benefit of the doubt and went to bat for you. But the musician’s late arrivals, late getting started, was totally unprofessional and there was a harmonica player missing in action until 7:15ish.. That said, when you are on stage you are fabulous. </div><div><br/></div><div>The Y’s position is that they contracted for 30 man hours of performance, and got about 23, if that. Their question to me was, how would you like to handle this? If I were to do the calculations, based on an hourly assumption, the YMCA would only owe you an additional $991.67, rather than $1750. I was hoping to hear from Sidd today as to how he wanted to handle all this, and Lisa D’Angelo felt I should  outline our disappointment to you and see how you want to handle it? I would have preferred to meet you in person to talk it out, and was waiting to hear from Sidd before setting something up…</div><div><br/></div><div>At least this way, you know what the issues are. I will try to get a response from Sidd tomorrow. In fact I will copy both he and Lisa. When would you like to meet?</div><div><br/></div><div>Best,</div><div><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(70, 70, 70);">Joy</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial;">Joy Campanaro</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial;">Executive Vice President, Co-owner</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial;">Total Gym Global Corp</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial;">Mobile:  </span><a href="tel:(858)%20967-9653" style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">858.967.9653</a><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial;"> </span></div><div style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.totalgym.com/" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">www.TotalGym.com</a></div><div style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><br/></div><div><br/></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt; text-align: left; color: black; border-width: 1pt medium medium; border-style: solid none none; padding: 3pt 0in 0in; border-top-color: rgb(181, 196, 223);"><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">From:</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>David Patrone &lt;<a href="mailto:davidpatrone@gmail.com" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">davidpatrone@gmail.com</a>&gt;</div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Date:</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 5:53 PM</div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">To:</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>Joy Campanaro &lt;<a href="mailto:joy@totalgym.com" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">joy@totalgym.com</a>&gt;</div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Subject:</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>check</div></div><div><br/></div><div>hi Joy,</div><div><br/></div><div>I have to pay my musicians, they are getting impatient with me and I'm disappointed that it has almost been a week without word. maybe i missed your email?</div><div><br/></div><div>David </div></div></div><div><br/></div></span>
