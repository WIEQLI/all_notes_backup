In this way you might classify it as a war because either of these groups are practiced at either using or breaking current laws or regulations. One of them writes legislation to restrict freedom while the other breaks laws to make money from the same people. I have seen with my own eyes and strongly believe that prohibition in this country is killing a lot of creative and sensitive people while simultaneously putting money in the pockets of people with criminal intentions beyond the search for variations of consciousness. Although I'm not picking a fight with organized crime directly, obviously my actions to eliminate prohibition could be seen as a threat to their income and may seek to hinder folks like me who have been learning the system and watching how they keep us in line, the kickbacks and the handouts in broad daylight, even pushing it pridefully to the vets like, &quot;You deserve to be put to sleep with just enough to afford an apartment in some place where you will be forgotten.&quot; and the impossible urge to sit back and say &quot;I'll take your dime while you take twenty to open the gate a little wider for me.&quot; and if you think that's a little crazy, just look at the money, a comparison to the budgets of defense and section 8.</span></div></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 33, 41); font-size: 14px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: pre-wrap; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><div style="position: relative; white-space: pre-wrap; direction: ltr; text-align: left;"><div><br/></div></div></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 33, 41); font-size: 14px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: pre-wrap; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><div style="position: relative; white-space: pre-wrap; direction: ltr; text-align: left;"><span style="position: relative; white-space: pre-wrap; direction: ltr;">It doesn't matter to me whether you agree with this or not, a serious problem has come to my attention and I am going to join this fight as someone who is adamantly opposed to the horrible consequence of Prohibition, the subjugation of personal rights, personally and as someone who is a patriot, not of this country but someone who espouses the ideals and the tenets of the Framers of the Constitution which seem to have been [hopefully not forgotten; only] misplaced.</span></div></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 33, 41); font-size: 14px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: pre-wrap; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><div style="position: relative; white-space: pre-wrap; direction: ltr; text-align: left;"><div><br/></div></div></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 33, 41); font-size: 14px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: pre-wrap; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><div style="position: relative; white-space: pre-wrap; direction: ltr; text-align: left;"><span style="position: relative; white-space: pre-wrap; direction: ltr;">This also means that I have to keep on the straight and narrow. I'll admit that the impetus to do what I want has been a major factor in taking this journey; but, that doesn't change the validity of my position. OK, so unfortunately I cannot enjoy the freedoms I am fighting for, just like the Marine Corps, which requires a sometimes draconian and Spartan structure to defend a free and undisciplined Democracy. I'[m not sure what it takes to restore one.</span></div></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 33, 41); font-size: 14px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: pre-wrap; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><div style="position: relative; white-space: pre-wrap; direction: ltr; text-align: left;"><div><br/></div></div></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 33, 41); font-size: 14px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: pre-wrap; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><div style="position: relative; white-space: pre-wrap; direction: ltr; text-align: left;"><span style="position: relative; white-space: pre-wrap; direction: ltr;">To Marines it is important to know that our families are safe back home and to know that our bodies will be retrieved. This allows us to remain fully engaged on the battlefield. In an effort to remain fully engaged I'm sending you this email to strongly assert you not believe anything you hear about me that comes from any source that is not my own mouth. Just like millions of other citizens and corporations, count that my facebook and other sources of social media will be compromised eventually. It will be easy to know if it's me because the message will sound like me</span></div></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 33, 41); font-size: 14px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: pre-wrap; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><div style="position: relative; white-space: pre-wrap; direction: ltr; text-align: left;"><div><br/></div></div></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 33, 41); font-size: 14px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: pre-wrap; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><div style="position: relative; white-space: pre-wrap; direction: ltr; text-align: left;"><span style="position: relative; white-space: pre-wrap; direction: ltr;">If I am ever kidnapped or thrown in jail, you are not to come to my defense or aid in any personal way, I will not accept your help, I will not accept your personal resources, your finances or your protection. Someone I hope will create anonymous ways of helping if that should happen.</span></div></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 33, 41); font-size: 14px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: pre-wrap; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><div style="position: relative; white-space: pre-wrap; direction: ltr; text-align: left;"><div><br/></div></div></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 33, 41); font-size: 14px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: pre-wrap; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><div style="position: relative; white-space: pre-wrap; direction: ltr; text-align: left;"><span style="position: relative; white-space: pre-wrap; direction: ltr;">I don't know if I can shield you from the kind of people who would take advantage of our relationship by using that as leverage or punishment; but you must believe that this is not just probable but this skill has been honed by the people with whom I have become acquainted, Their methods make it important to suggest that anyone who comes to your door or your inbox with my name on their lips for any purpose by email or by survey who don't fit my usual pattern of estrangement should be considered to be the most despicable kind of people and should they come to your door under the pretense of friendliness or the threat of justice, they should be dealt with by obfuscation at the very least. Anyone who approaches you about me or this industry, friends, family, they know I'm writing this, it will be posted on my social media, please remember this, I'm sorry if it comes to your door but dont hesitate to treat it for what it is: aggression.</span></div></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 33, 41); font-size: 14px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: pre-wrap; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><div style="position: relative; white-space: pre-wrap; direction: ltr; text-align: left;"><div><br/></div></div></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 33, 41); font-size: 14px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: pre-wrap; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><div style="position: relative; white-space: pre-wrap; direction: ltr; text-align: left;"><span style="position: relative; white-space: pre-wrap; direction: ltr;">Even if you agree with me wholeheartedly and were willing to support what must seem a little crazy even for me, I won't accept your help. Even if you are sure I'm crazy and need to go somewhere to get well, I won't accept that either. I'm completely confident about two things and neither of them is that I'm not crazy. Crazy might explain why I believe the following two things :</span></div></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 33, 41); font-size: 14px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: pre-wrap; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><div style="position: relative; white-space: pre-wrap; direction: ltr; text-align: left;"><div><br/></div></div></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 33, 41); font-size: 14px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: pre-wrap; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><div style="position: relative; white-space: pre-wrap; direction: ltr; text-align: left;"><span style="position: relative; white-space: pre-wrap; direction: ltr;">1.

Shame is the killer and the bully loves to use it in taunting tones like the proverbial k-i-s-s-i-n-g rhyme of our childhood, taking a good thing and making it shameful, These bullies are not oafs, they are not dumb children forced to live from their brute strength like slaves, they are calculated and impressive in their intelligence for they have cultivated great minds to stay in power just as they have cultivated strength to intimidate. What MLK understood and prudently hid inside of his work is that one day his dream fulfilled would mean that the lines of the oppressed and the oppressor would not be as easily identified as by racial makeup or artistic talent or social strata.</span></div></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 33, 41); font-size: 14px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: pre-wrap; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><div style="position: relative; white-space: pre-wrap; direction: ltr; text-align: left;"><div><br/></div></div></div><div style="position: relative; direction: ltr; text-align: left;"><span style="position: relative; direction: ltr;"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">James Baldwin, said although speaking of a different type of rights violation in America often spoke of the racial dividing line and as a white kide growing up in the 70s I remember what it felt like to want to disassociate from being a legacy of the &quot;problem,&quot; while wondering why it wasn't spoken of that color wasn't the dividing line that i saw, I mean, sure, I got hit for being white, chased, ostricized here and there; but, the line I saw was money. People spoke of the importance of education and yet that wasn't a line I saw either, I mean sure, you need a degree to get some high paying jobs but it's not really the truth, only a half truth. The turth is that there are lots of ways to get that thing that really matters: Money. Criminality was not, in my neighborhood, a line either. Everybody was a hustler where I spent my childhood, again the line was still money. Talent, strength, size, dedication were shown to me early in life to be assets that could be bought and for a lot cheaper than it cost to cultivate them. Wall Street, Atlantic City, Vegas, LA, from the streets to the screen, all you had to have to overcome was a little extra cash, or one incredibly charismatic frontman to motivate a bunch of overlooked resources. Again we are talking about currency here. You can talk all you want about valoueas but as a kid growing up in America, I saw race as a distraction from the real problem, I knew my family was broke and so was everyone I knew. You can imagine my confusion as my mom worked 16 hour days and we rented two houses away from the cats that hated me cause I was supposed to be rich, it was like they were almost more angry that I was like them, that somehow because I was white AND broke, they needed to kick my ass more and THAT was when I realized why that made sense. If white folks are broke then they are either broken or color aint the problem... this is how Truth is revealed, when you can't escape it. now I am not in any way diminishing the challenge of being black in a lot of the places in this country or the struggle of the non-white in this country since it began. Hell no, and if you believe that I am ignoring something so obvious then ask yourself if your perception is distorted by an agenda; because, I never said that, to restate in another way, what I saw as a boy was that a lot of people liked to blame other people who were obviously not the problem for not being successful at the thing they were trying to accomplish night now; and, they liked to blame an old environment for a current struggle. My elementary school had a really good bunch of buses. They had chains and a garage, defrosters, hell I don't know all that, they had great drivers, and the roads were ploughed (snowplow = plough) quickly in my school district. whatever the reasons, my school almost never took a snow day. You would sit and you'd be up all night cause you knew it was a good storm, the streets were quiet, you'd look at the line of snow on the window sill and measure, 3 inches, 4 inches, it had to be at least 4. as early as 4 or 5am you'd tune in to the AM station and each school had a number, some of my favorite radio was thousands of numbers read by this guy who sounded like the President to me. so I would sit and wait for the number to be called and it would be like 889/900/901/902/ 9 0 5/ 9076/907 those are arbitrary number because I can't remember mine but every damn snow day we wouldn't get called. I'm sure I'm exaggerating but when we did get a snow day it was often only a half daY. So the catholic school kids were always getting off and you could see the kids sledding from our school on what was really &quot;our hill.&quot; You could see the town's trucks ploughing the streets and then there were these guys who installed snowploughs on the fronts of their pickup trucks to make a little extra money in the winter, you'd see them ploughing private driveways and local establishments and my dad was one of them. He had a yellow one mounted on the front of a Ford Bronco. When</span></span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap; line-height: 1.45;">I got</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap; line-height: 1.45;">a snowday sometimes I got to sit in the truck while my day was ploughing. He had a CB and spoke with other drivers who would go out and plough all night cause that's when the streets were empty. As a result of this, I learned at an early age that some people work in the snow, some people work in the sun, some in the day and some in the night, and unless you're making extra bread, most people love to take a snow day, even after the roads have been plowed and talk about how hard it was to get to work.</span></div><div style="position: relative; direction: ltr; text-align: left;"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap; line-height: 1.45;"><br/></span></div><div style="position: relative; direction: ltr; text-align: left;"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap; line-height: 1.45;">Some folks</span> <span style="line-height: 1.45; white-space: pre-wrap;">like to stay inside</span></div><div style="position: relative; direction: ltr; text-align: left;"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap; line-height: 1.45;">even after the fields have dried</span></div><div style="position: relative; direction: ltr; text-align: left;"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap; line-height: 1.45;">talking about how they tried</span></div><div style="position: relative; direction: ltr; text-align: left;"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap; line-height: 1.45;"><br/></span></div><div><br/></div></span>
