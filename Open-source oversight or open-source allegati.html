<div><span><div>Lake SOS or o s s o space o s s a</div><div>. I wanted to be about you know Sherlock Wikileaks but WikiLeaks tied to a network of people that dig into investigations and you know they rate each other so that it's not like you know someone time person can just jump on there and make like a wild accusation and then you know destroy someone's reputation so it has to be over site for the oversight and then there has to be some sort of thing that has to back up any allegations but there needs to be a like a court of public opinion such that they have a real bite so in the book there be a group of anonymous like enforcers maybe they'd be Killers maybe they'd be punished them physically maybe they would put them under house arrest or just you know I think that if someone is a public figure public politician they could have a disclosure and a full disclosure would be like a a reckoning it at a telling of every other wrongs and they let it out there and they say like what I'm here to do public service and and this kind of thing is unacceptable to me full disclosure I did these things this is my character and then they can't be held in a ransom you know by any subterfuge any other types of criminals can't hold them you know them and then the extortion doesn't exist so that really working for the people this might upset the criminals but the good thing will be that if they really want to know how to work the criminals they just go to the guy that the criminals are trying to take out he should know a lot about the organization and I'm not against criminal activity but some criminal activity I'm against you no like murder and rape and the stealing of someone's property and things like that and not credit you know crime is more complex than the Ten Commandments but I think we let it get that way because we want to have some little wiggle room in the gray area so we are at fault also and vigilantism and assuming that God works things out in the end I think has made this place to Hell on Earth for a lot of people and I think they crime needs to be re-evaluated some things are not a crime I am totally against putting a man in jail for assisting or doing on his own changing his mental state for recreation I think that that to make that criminal or to make that industry Criminal has been one of the great tragedies of the last 100 years. </div><div>You see we have run out of land to explore we have run out of free places to go where we live in the margins where we cut out our own spot and as a result the journey has to go in order that's where the exploration lies and somebody got there first some criminal some real dick head went and cut us off from the opportunity to explore the final frontier the real final frontier the only Frontier that ever really matter is the inner Frontier and Psychonauts I mean I don't think that it is any coincidence whatsoever that LSD DMT mushrooms marijuana that these psychoactive chemicals which allow one to escape the boundaries of this physical plane and the mental boundaries with it I find it no surprise that those are the highest scheduled drugs for prohibition in the world United Nations has them scheduled as schedule 1 and in some cases in most cases that's higher priority for prohibition meaning they are considered to be more dangerous then crystal meth or heroin which both can be prescribed by the way under various names crystal meth is prescribed desoxyn amphetamine is prescribed as adderall that you may not have known that and opiates are one of the most widely explored Pharmaceuticals in modern-day I mean you can find more versions of opiate and the legal pharmaceutical Market that are prescribed over-prescribed heavily prescribed every single day and yet no one today is doing research on DMT or rather legally no doctors are really doing deep research on LSD DMT psilocybin or THC large way it's not the word I'm looking for basically if you're doing research on LSD or DMT you're considered pseudo scientist or someone who's out there on The Fringe when these are probably the most relevant things to be researching right now what happens inside the mind and how do we get break out of this boundary that has a seeing everything the same way how do we break that boundary how do we change our perspective from the inside how do we look at things another way when everything is being explored it has been explored how do we come to a new philosophy how do we come to a new type of medicine and we are not going to find it using only the scientific method we need to find a way to come from an angle that has not been considered yet I mean how many people are ignoring this fact I mean how many times in history have we vastly benefited from a slight shift of perception just a little change in the way we look at things for how long are we going to go before we accept the fact that being weird gets us places we were never able to access before and I don't mean to Lititz legitimize a lifetime of recreation that's not what I'm saying here I'm saying take away the prohibition take away the criminality of exploring one's personality and body and and mind and soul and sensory experience and sentient experience take the crime out of that it does not belong there they will look at us in the future as barbarians they will they look at us as barbarians who wouldn't let our children learn who cut ourselves off from the spirit and cut ourselves off from the possibility of utilizing the tools that are available to us to change our perception to expand our awareness and they are going to laugh at us laugh at us and they are going to say what fools what barbarians but brutal f****** people they were to put the thinkers in jail to put Psychonauts in a jail cell with the psychopath how f****** brutal they're going to look at law enforcement today just like we look at these guys that were using head screws and leeches. So new parent</div><div><br/></div><div>So to mr. Law enforcement gentleman I too wish for you to understand that I respect the job you do tremendously I was a marine I have had experience trying to help people that are dangerous trying to pull people away from intense situations I have had not a law enforcement careers experience doing it definitely but I have slight imagination a slight empathy for what it must be like to not want to ruin a man's life but to get the message through his head that what he's doing is unacceptable I fully appreciate that because I have lots of friends who live on the fridge and I care for them and sometimes they need to change and I worked in recovery for a long time I seen the same thing and I've seen behavior that disgust me and it reminds me of things that I don't like about the man I have been or M but I've also seen how absolutely stupid and considerate meaning we have not taken into consideration the underlined system of Being Human and what punishment means you know what does it mean to take a man who forms a business out of bringing other people a product that they enjoy tremendously and he brings them that product and he goes to jail and then learns to be an animal and to come out of that jail not like a rehabilitated man but like a man who now sees the grit that lies underneath of everything and how to use that grit to keep him from having to go back and experience it again. </div><div>Wooden and who wouldn't? I mean think about it here you are you Ben you thought you were sorry you thought you were a pretty slick entrepreneur and you were doing your thing but you couldn't exactly be loud and proud about it but you know you figured out a way to pay your taxes create a cover and then you get caught and you go to jail and then you start hearing horror stories from the guy you're in the cell width and then you start meeting some people who are just playing horrible. And the thing is however you got there in order to stay there for long you're going to have to put some of these guys at least that you're not working for the other side and putting them at ease means different things for different people making your bones so to speak to put it in that poetic Italian mafia way doing something that no law enforcement officer whatever do so that they believe you are not one and can then allow you to continue to operate in their midst without you worrying about them getting paranoid and just simply getting rid of the problem so to speak. This is real man this is real and it happens every day all day to lots of people so we really need to redefine crime in this country and anything that you do to yourself in the comfort of your home which somehow you manage to buy pay for get maintain rent maintain a job whatever however you managed to make that happen and you decide to go change your perspective whether that means smoking a plant or putting a f****** needle in your arm it's nobody's business but your own and it should not be a crime now neglecting your children and all that other stuff because you're addicted to opiates how is putting you in jail going to help those kids? how is slapping huge funds that you couldn't afford the first place going to help those kids how is sending you to jail because you couldn't pay the fines then you couldn't afford the first place which might have been why you were escaping how is that going to help the f****** kids and how is that person a f****** criminal now? again head screws and leeches that's our criminal system today head screws and leeches and a bunch of quacks who are too arrogant to admit they can't solve the problem and a bunch of politicians who are too ashamed to admit that they don't have any control and they've been bought and sold by the underlying oligarchy that really rules the world and I'm not a f****** conspiracy theorist I don't believe in all this other but I mean who knows what to believe really honestly if you say it just doesn't exist then I say you've been bought and if I bought doesn't mean that you got money what it means is you're a pussy and you aren't prepared to spend the time to actually investigate something that might wiggle you out of your comfort zone and that's a shame because this country used to be made up of individual individual is rugged individualist into that Forest of doubt and the place where other man wouldn't go to cut out living and that's why we have this place that's why we have the possibility of the idea this place because the place no longer exists that idea of the place that used to be here yeah that exist but but back then there was all kinds of b******* happening to all the crap that we did to our own indigenous people here all the people we killed in the name of what? I don't even know what we were doing but the point is we have an idea of a deal of a place that we could spread in in and really we have something really we could do something with what we have here and you f****** people are too afraid of how you'll be perceived for us to actually get anywhere and the thing is who discounting the power of fear in The Human Experience power of fear in The Human Experience makes a sensitive artistic intelligent valuable to the future of our world takes that person and discounts his experience it takes away his art because you cannot access art well you can exercise when you're afraid but it it turns into something different you see malicious intent everywhere and who wants to live in a world with art it's all changed with an underline coat of persistent malaise malicious intent and paranoia because man I see it everywhere it's everywhere people are afraid to look too deeply know what's going on man and I'm f****** sick of it and I don't give a f*** if I use drugs or if I'm an addict whatever you want to f****** call me the fact is it shouldn't be a f****** crime to one Explorer a different perception a different perspective a different thing I guess what you know why I suffer from Financial issues because I'm too afraid to walk out my door and get accused of doing something that shouldn't be f****** wrong to do that's the only thing that holds me back on a daily basis well that's because I don't what your uneducated opinion to send me to a place where I become an animal in the zoo where have to become some kind of f****** horrible thing to survive just because your uneducated opinion about what this chemical does inside you don't f****** know how do you know you're going to sit there and Judge Me by the behavior of some people that you corralled into this fear-based system here is something that I am going to act like a crackhead that I'm going to steal from my family or hurt the people around me just to score well, the same could be said about air or water or food because I guarantee if you go without those for very long there are any number of things despicable that one might do thank God none of you assholes has banished to make air water or food illegal, yet so far you just have to pay for them. </div><div><br/></div></span>
