<span><div>I don't know who you are but I would like to tell you that you are about to help an uncountable number of people who are going through exactly what you're going through right now. Im going to give you couple possible answers and a few wild guesses but i want to start by making a distinction between contemplation and carrying out what is  you are you don't have to kiss anything you want the most selfish way for a conscious being to leave this physical playground we call The Universe. Suicide is the most efficient way for us to transfer all our  our pain directly to every human that cares anything at all about us. At the very least spirituality notwithstanding, it is a horrible thing for the living who are left behind to endure; and, if we're being honest we really don't have any actual proof whether we're even relieving ourselves of the pain! For all we know, it could carry right over into whatever exists after our physical bodies die. You could be setting yourself up to feel that wat for eternity. I know what it feels like to be so unhappy, so frustrated, so unable to find my way and unable to reach out, that I would be willing to put the barrel of a loaded shotgun my mouth and begin to pull the trigger. I know what it feels like because I have done it. I have made the decision to de because I just couldn't live another day the way I was living and I didn't know how to change. After enough nights and mornings I had made the decision to die. While I was pulling the trigger I had an awakening. It occurred to me for the first time in my life, the amount of pain that I was about to cause a bunch of people, who didn't deserve to have to deal with the aftermath of my actions. How many people would blame themselves for what I did? How many people would have to write off the debts I owed them as uncollected? How many of them would be traumatized? What stories would my brothers tell themselves about their brother who killed himself? What would my Mother say about her son, my Father. How many nights would they spend bewildered without the ability to call me up and ask me why? What right did I have to take their son from them and to transfer all that pain, just because I couldn't figure it out, just because I was ready to give up? I saw in my mind's eye what the scene would look like when my brother or someone else I knew finally found my body. I had to ask myself, did I have the right to take my own life? Did I have to right to give that ghastly moment to another person while I still had the poowr to turn back? Was that final act of defiance the last whimper of a petulant child, smashing the toys and running away, so angry at the universe for not handing me what I thought I deserved. I had to ask my self in that moment, had I really tried everything? Had I asked for help from someone? Had I even told anyone what I was dealing with? I had to admit that I had not. I had to admit that I was taking the easy way out. It occurred to me that I did not have the right to do those things. I relaxed and heard the trigger click back forward, I was never more afraid  in my life at that moment realizing that even suicide was not an option, not really, not if I was honest; and that honesty, the ability to actually see what was real and what I had been telling myself was real is what saved my life. The ability to be honest and really look inside for the truth I was hiding from myself saved my life. I don't know how to transfer that ability. It's like suddenly seeing that you've been fighting for the wrong side, and worse, you've done terrible things to innocent people, Even worse when I realized that a big part of me actually knew this it all along; but, it was easier to pretend you were ignorant. When I came to that realization that I had been blatantly lying to myself while pretending not to notice; when I realized the way that I had forced others to lie with me or &quot;leave me hanging&quot; so I could wickedly use their exasperated departure to explain the consequences I was experiencing because I refused to hear their clearly transmitted solution to whatever situation I had getten mysefl into.  just blame them when I let other people down and the things I was going to have to do to make it right. Oh my God the Ego was ready to kill me rather than admit Mea Culpa. I wanted to puil that trigger more than ever; and, this entire thought process, from the moment I tasted the gun oil of that barrel in my mouth, flashbacks of my life and flash forwards of my death and the aftermath all happened in the space of about one second. That barrel was still in my mouth, my finger was still on the trigger and I have no idea how I didn't pull it. I swear to you that I wanted to pull that trigger more than I wanted all the cocaine and booze and any thing else that ever made me feel complete in my whole life.</div><div><br/></div><div>Honesty. I just couldn't get around the fact that I did not have the right to kill myself, to throw away this body, this opportunity to be a conscious, living organism in an Era when all things are pretty much possible and the ones that aren't are the ones I could be working on. moreso than any time in the last 14 Billion years and here I was, standing here with a shotgun in my mouth, unable to see that all of this was accessible to me if I could just reach out and ask someone who had been where I have been, how they got out and if they could help me. The Ego did not want to hear that at all, the little bastard was screaming for me to pull that trigger rather than to take responsibility for my part in everything. Once you ring that bell,.. </div><div><br/></div><div>Fortunately for you, you have already begun by telling the Truth and believe it or not that was the hardest part of the process, you could have just went out and taken your own life; however, you did something else first and I believe what you did is the hardest thing in the world for a Human to do…. you asked someone that wasn’t yourself for help. Most people would rather give up their wildest dreams rather than ask someone for help, especially if there's any shame attached to the current situation,  in your case it sounds as though you may feel some shame and that it is your fault that you're feeling the way you do or that people seem to have abandoned you because of &quot;lying.&quot; It's easy to relate to that way of thinking and that  there's a  negative outcome and you believe have attached shame to a situation and then you decided that a behavior that you felt shame for created the situation in which you feel alone and abandoned.</div><div><br clear="none"/></div><div>I-d like to suggest that you suspect  the consequences are a result of behavior which you (first) made a decision to do and (second) feel shame for... If you have decided to do something (and I'm pretty sure whatever it is has been done a million times by millions of people) and then you also decided to accept guilt for that behavior... You are experiencing the worst kind of conflict of interest. The internal one.</div><div><br/></div><div>Make sure that your struggle is</div><div>between who you are and who you want to be</div><div>and not</div><div>who you are (which includes who you want to be)</div><div>and who you suspect others find acceptable.</div><div><br/></div><div>who do you look like</div><div>to yourself?</div><div>to others?</div><div>how do you appear?</div><div>how do you arrive?</div><div>are you Red Carpet Runway</div><div>or are you Dumpster Dive?</div><div><br/></div><div>The first evidence of change</div><div>is the identification</div><div>of objectionable behavior</div><div><br/></div><div> is because you feel shame for that behavior  but I want to tell you that  plenty of people  love and remain in contact with Liars all the time and every day  people stay in marriages with cheaters  people  have lots of reasons for the things that they do and most of the time it has nothing to do with you.   It is easy to relate to that obstacle. In fact, it's so unusual for someone to overcome this that most humans would swear even to themselves that it's not a problem for them when in fact they've never ask someone for help not really, and then many times they develop a resentment towards the person they wanted to but they never asked not really. They may have asked for help in exchange for something but to be in enough pain to ask for help and to be willing to accept it is a tremendous blessing and it is he first step out of the pain that I am in. so you have already  “stepped over “ those broken people and you are close to the shore. In this case the act of asking the question it's kind of answering the question and that's how you know when you're ready. It could be considered a mistake to let this moment go by and not take advantage of focusing on who you want to be making a pledge to change for to accept who you are to not accept it and it is  an amazing opportunity  two  discover that  you want to be something different. Most people go through life never really knowing.</div><div>so what do you do next? the first thing is to reach out to someone near you. Go to meetings to try and find some people who have similar obstacles as you and ask how they recovered.  listen closely and ask as many questions as occur to you. while you are learning what to do from the people who you know had the same issues and no how to do something about it for themselves</div><div><br/></div></span>
