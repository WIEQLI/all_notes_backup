Open mind and a new experience.
Repeat every word that the speaker says.
That's how you listen
Don't forget you hated the speakers. Those fucking arrogant speakers.
My name is David Patrone, I have recovered from a hopeless state of mind, as a result of a lot of work, much of this work is clearly outlined in the first 167 pages of the book, "Alcoholics Anonymous"
I want to thank _______________ for having me here tonight. I enjoy service and I enjoy speaking and I like that my experience can be an asset to myself and others by relating my experience honestly.
My alcoholism manifests in other areas of my life including drug addiction so please forgive me if I mention something that disturbs you. 
Alcohol has been involved in nearly all aspects of my life from a very young age.
I have had many sobriety dates and some long lengths of time abstinent from all intoxicants. This was essential for me to successfully complete this work.
I have had several amazing sponsors; some of whom knew this, some of them did not. It works better when they know, in case you're wondering. Asking is one of the most difficult things I have ever had to do. Harder than asking anyone out; much harder than proposing to my wife; hell it was harder than asking if we should divorce. It is worth it.
I have worked all 12 steps, in order, several times. There are many ways to do this, I recommend the BBA workshop for those of you who want to be very thorough. I did not do it that way until my third or fourth time through the steps but it was a significant awakening and I feel a responsibility to stress that this method achieved the greatest awakening from the 12 steps for me, second only to attending classes where I studied the Bhagavad Gita and Shrimad Bagavatam.
As a result of this work I have learned how to seek the guidance of my higher power in all that I do. I am sometimes capable of this.
As a result of this work, I am recovered, even when I am not sober. I rarely mention that last part because I was clean and sober when I achieved these spiritual experiences and it is my recommendation that you do the same whether or not you think you have a problem.
As a result of this work I will tell you that I do believe that anything is possible if you leave the anything up to your Higher Power.
I can tell you that I think about using often, sometimes all day; and, that this is not a reason to drink or use; but, I have used that as an excuse to relapse. Reasons and excuses are different to me. That is one, small way of regaining power. This will not be sufficient if you are of the Alcoholic type.
I had a home group, a couple of them actually.
When doing this work and for many years, I uwould sually go to several meetings every day.
It's important that you know that I don't speak for AA.Â I only share my "experience strength and hope" as they suggest in the "Big Book" "Alcoholics Anonymous.
I would like to congratulate the token takers and the newcomers, whether you spoke up or not. This is a place where you will find answers to questions that most people never ask themselves.
I recently heard someone share this to the newcomers in the rooms:
"Welcome to AA
The bad news is that these are the most expensive seats in the world
The good news is that you've already paid for them.
It's also important to note that you can stop paying for them any time you like, more suffering does not get you better seats in AA."
I thought that was funny, tonight, better seats might get you more suffering; but, I'll try to keep the suffering bearable.
it's important for me to be honest and so I'll mention that most of the things you are about to hear, I've heard from someone else first, especially the funny stuff. You have my permission to repeat anything I say here for the purposes of recovery.
When I hear something that sounds true to me I write them down, I used to use my phone to take notes; but, it was definitely brought to my attention that this created a distraction to people around me. That pissed me off; as intolerance often does, and eventually I went back to writing in a book; and now, people using their phones doesn't bother me at all.
I'm an Agnostic, as were many of the original members of AA, which is probably why Chapter 4 is titled, "We Agnostics." That was important to me in the beginning because there was a lot of God talk in the rooms from a lot of people who seemed to me to have spent very little time considering the impact of that word on someone who has a "Spiritual Malady" which is identified as one of the three characteristics which contribute to the condition of Alcoholism or Addiction.
Agnostics get a bad rap; simply because most people have the wrong definition of Agnostic.
Merriam Webster's Dictionary defines an Agnostic as:
a person who holds the view that any ultimate reality is unknown and probably unknowable;
probably unknowable, it seems that according to Merriam and Webster, agnostics are even agnostic about agnosticism. Word.
It is not a description that defines a philosophy. Agnostics believe that the existence of God is neither provable nor disprovable and unfathomable regardless due to the fact that you cannot possibly grasp something that is infinite; conceptually.
So if you Identify with that, I want tell you, "Welcome."
I have spent my life searching for existence of God and no one, not Priests, Ministers, Rabbis, Monks, Devotees, Philosophers, Mathemeticians, Physicists, Christians, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Taoists or any other of the religions or philosophies that I have encountered in my search, have ever been able to prove to me that there is a God.
fortunately for me, no one has ever been able to disprove God to me either, yet.
If you believe in God, in any God, that's great, I mean it should make this pretty easy for you. By definition I think most people who believe in God believe there is only one God; though you may have a different name for it. I call him Krishna and that's just because I can relate to the Truth I read in the books that call him that. If it doesn't sound True to me, it sounds like something a human made up to explain something they don't fully understand; which, is acceptable since we don't have that capacity anyway.
I recommend that you Trust in God and seek to hear his instructions. I have no idea how to tell you to do this. I ask for direction and for my inspiration to be influenced by God and then I more or less Trust my judgment. Experience has shown me that it is very wise to have a trusted human advisor to clear these ideas even if not acting on them. I found the most success when this was a person with whom I could actually be totally honest with; and, the work that is the 12 steps of Alcoholic Anonymous will help you to create that relationship accomplish a surprising level of honesty.
If you're going to hang out here you should read this book. It looks like a long book; and, I feel very comfortable telling you that the first 167 pages are sufficient to recover from Alcoholism if you read it and do what is suggested with someone who knows it well. The rest is extra credit, War Stories and specific instructions for certain situations.
In the forward to the first edition it states:
To show alcoholics precisely how we have recovered is the main purpose of this book.
there are other purposes like waking up your sponsees and keeping the door open while you bring in your groceries; but, they're not really stressed in the book. I used to hide my scale in there; the cops never opened any of my books and they searched my house a bunch of times. Truth wasn't on their checklist I suppose. Funny, it might have set me free.
"We hope no further authentication is necessary but unfortunately there usually is some further authentication and it goes over that too.
the book goes on to describe who is an alcoholic.
If you go out every night with the intention of getting loaded and you do so, that does not make you an alcoholic.
If you decide you want to have a big blowout on your birthday; and, you get a bunch of coke and strippers; and, you end up in some Mexican Jail cause of the crazy stuff you did in a blackout, that doesn't qualify you for the title of "Alcoholic."
Further authentication is necessary.
If; on the other hand, you have tried to control your drinking and found that once started you had no control over the amount or when you were going to stop... Then, this book says, you might be an alcoholic. Actually it says you are PROBABLY alcoholic.
And if this is the case then you may have experienced powerlessness over alcohol.
in Chapter 4 (conveniently titled WE Agnostics) on p45 P2 it states:
Lack of power, that was our dilemma, we had to find a power greater than ourselves.. well that's exactly what this book is about:
connecting with this power.
now I'm an agnostic and I have had a spiritual experience as a result of working these steps, and I have not found it necessary to take a drink in over a year and this has been one hell of a year.
I often think I might not be done but after doing this work the way that it is outlined in this book I have been able to connect to and rely upon a higher power which has changed my life, my outlook and spirit in ways I cannot explain, qualify or quantify without sounding like the kindof guy I didn't like listening to whenever I was a newcomer.
I OD'd and died on December 9th of 2014. This is not my sobriety date, in fact, the first thing I wanteed to do when I got out of the hospital was to go and see if my stash was still there. What I mean is this, dying is not going to scare you sober; so, you don't have to die to relate to this, if you're using a substance which is known to kill people; there is a good chance you will not recover from death. I was lucky; the guy I was using with had some experience with reviving people, I was his 9th success and he was very persistent in his efforts  to do this, he performed a few non-traditional techniques in addition to 25 minutes of CPR. This while he was also high; which, may have been what enabled him to do this. He was insistent that the paramedics continue trying to revive me after they told him twice and after two narcan injections that I was dead. When I came to, they were lifting me out. They seemed as surprised to see me as I was to see them.
If you have come back from doing the worst possible thing you can imagine and yet you went and did it again, you are in a room of like-minded people. I say that because it is important that someone who is recovered be approachable and convincing to be of service to someone who has been to the edge. People who have been to the Edge, rarely take the advice of others. That's how they made it to the Edge in the first place. It's just not an intrinsic characteristic of people like us; and so, if I want the opportunity to be of service to you, I have to be honest about my experience and if you identify with that, I have to be available so that it occurs to you to talk to me. If I don't have something really important to do, and I consider recovery work to be the act of one soul directly assisting another and I consider that to be of the utmost importance to my Creator. I could be wrong about this; so, I ask every day to send me some work; and, if you show up and it occurs to us to have this conversation, I want to make sure that I'm not in the way of your recovery.
So, I tell you what I have done and that I have recovered from a hopeless state; and, this room is full of people just like me who need to be of service. If I am not doing something that is somewhere near the level of vitally important to me and my Creator, I will most likely start coming up with ideas which aren't vitally important to anyone but me and I will take great offense at your suggestion that not do them.
I am a writer and this is one of the thngs that I write about. I gain a tremendous amount of value from exploring my perception vs reality; because the difference between them is another reason why I have experienced problems in my life.
that's why I'm here tonight. If you don't know what to do or how to do it, come and see me or any of my friends here with that sparkle in their eye and we'll show you what we did to get that sparkle; or, to recover that sparkle after a long dark trip into a place with which we are both familiar.
If you are willing, the book says, "willingness is the key." For a long time before they wrote this book, that has been pointed out by every person who has ever accomplished anything.
If lack of power is your dilemma, you will find power in this work. I gained access to something I couldn't have possibly conceived of before this work and without this work I would have died by my own hand a long time ago.
I do not claim to know what Krishna's plan is for me and I have no idea what is in store for you; but, I would be dead if I had not placed my will and my life over to the care of a God that I cannot understand.
I do not pray for others, Krishna's delegation of lessons for others is none of my business. I try to remove my problems from my thoughts and problems and be fully available for anything Krishna has in mind for me. I do this by saying His name throughout the day.
Thank you for letting me be of service.


If I don't trust you, you cannot trust me to be honest. I will probably be honest most of the time; but, I place the utmost importance on honesty as a constant exercise to remove fear-based thinking and actions. If you are not honest with me, I will probably avoid spending my time in a conversation with you. I think it is very disrespectful to waste a person's time; after all, we have a limited amount of time here, other assets can be obtained; but, time is limited and we never know when our time is going to be up. Be honest in as much as you can and try to keep people around you who can handle your Truth. That is the best advice I can give anyone for a productive and happy experience here on Earth. Lying is like a disease which saps you of your Spiritual energy and your mental resources. Lying is sometimes done to avoid having to deal with things in the moment, try not to do this. It's like a credit card that you're going to have to pay sometime in the future if you're going to have a relationship with the other being in that conversation. Honesty is how you pay for Freedom in advance.
If I'm not honest with you, My lies will compound themselves, In an effort to keep my story straight, I may even start to believe my lies because our words are possibilities which are generated in our thinking. Keeping multiple Truths in our minds takes up a lot of energy. Soon I may start to muddy the lines between the lies and the truth. Accountability is very important for detecting when you go off track; and, for this I need a trustworthy advisor; and that advisor cannot tell me something I know to be untrue or I will not respect his counsel and I will mitigate the parts of this counsel that I need. I need him to be hard on me and out of respect I will be hard on him. Honesty is simple and very difficult. To say, "I don't know" is a sign of respect to me. I have suffered a tremendous amount of pain from acting on information which I found out later to be a fabrication or an outright lie. I rarely forgive people who do this intentionally. I think it is the most disrespectful thing a sentient being can do to another one, mislead them intentionally; especially when, "I don't know" would have, in most cases, avoided the entire amount of damage that is  done by being irresponsible with your words.
I want to be honest with you. like to drink and use. I enjoy alcohol, I am not sober these days; and, alcohol and drugs are not a big problem in my life compared to other issues I face. I have completed this work such that I have had enough of a reprieve to give that up to God and God doesn't seem to me to be very concerned about that interfering with the work He has me doing now. It is many years since I began writing this piece which was originally intended as a reference guide for when I was asked to speak at AA meetings.
