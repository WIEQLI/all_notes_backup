Agnostics believe that you can't know</span></span></span><br/><span style="-webkit-line-break:after-white-space;"><span style="-webkit-nbsp-mode:space;"><span style="word-wrap:break-word;">So if you are an agnostic in the room tonight I want tell you Welcome,</span></span></span><br/><span style="-webkit-line-break:after-white-space;"><span style="-webkit-nbsp-mode:space;"><span style="word-wrap:break-word;">I have spent my life searching for existence of God and no-one, not priests ministers rabbis monks, devotees, Christians, Jews Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Taoists or any other of the religions or philosophies that I have encountered in my search have ever been able to prove to me that there is a God</span></span></span><br/><span style="-webkit-line-break:after-white-space;"><span style="-webkit-nbsp-mode:space;"><span style="word-wrap:break-word;">fortunately for me, no one else has ever been able to disprove God to me either.</span></span></span><br/><span style="-webkit-line-break:after-white-space;"><span style="-webkit-nbsp-mode:space;"><span style="word-wrap:break-word;">If you believe in God, in any God, that's great, I mean it should make this pretty easy for you. Trust in God, OK thanks for letting me share</span></span></span><br/><span style="-webkit-line-break:after-white-space;"><span style="-webkit-nbsp-mode:space;"><span style="word-wrap:break-word;">let me know when you want me to give you a token.</span></span></span><br/><span style="-webkit-line-break:after-white-space;"><span style="-webkit-nbsp-mode:space;"><span style="word-wrap:break-word;">Oh yeah, we're in a meeting of Alcoholics anonymous, I guess maybe we should talk for a minute about this book.</span></span></span><br/><span style="-webkit-line-break:after-white-space;"><span style="-webkit-nbsp-mode:space;"><span style="word-wrap:break-word;">The Name of This book is Alcoholics Anonymous and someone told me that this is from where the &quot;AA&quot; name comes from. it's just the title of the book we read.</span></span></span><br/><span style="-webkit-line-break:after-white-space;"><span style="-webkit-nbsp-mode:space;"><span style="word-wrap:break-word;">in the forward to the first edition it states:</span></span></span><br/><span style="-webkit-line-break:after-white-space;"><span style="-webkit-nbsp-mode:space;"><span style="word-wrap:break-word;">To show alcoholics precisely how we have recovered is the main purpose of this book.</span></span></span><br/><span style="-webkit-line-break:after-white-space;"><span style="-webkit-nbsp-mode:space;"><span style="word-wrap:break-word;">there are other purposes like waking up your sponsees and keeping the door open while you bring in your groceries but they're not really stressed in the book</span></span></span><br/><span style="-webkit-line-break:after-white-space;"><span style="-webkit-nbsp-mode:space;"><span style="word-wrap:break-word;">we hope no further authentication is necessary but unfortunately there usually is some further authentication and it goes over that too.</span></span></span><br/><span style="-webkit-line-break:after-white-space;"><span style="-webkit-nbsp-mode:space;"><span style="word-wrap:break-word;">the book goes on to describe who is an alcoholic.</span></span></span><br/><span style="-webkit-line-break:after-white-space;"><span style="-webkit-nbsp-mode:space;"><span style="word-wrap:break-word;">If you go out every night with the intention of getting loaded and you do so, that does not make you an alcoholic.</span></span></span><br/><span style="-webkit-line-break:after-white-space;"><span style="-webkit-nbsp-mode:space;"><span style="word-wrap:break-word;">If you decide you want to have a big blowout and you get a bunch of coke and strippers and you end up in some Mexican Jail cause of the crazy stuff you did in a blackout, that doesn't qualify you for membership in AA.</span></span></span><br/><span style="-webkit-line-break:after-white-space;"><span style="-webkit-nbsp-mode:space;"><span style="word-wrap:break-word;">If on the other hand, you have tried to control your drinking and found that once started you had no control over the amount or when you were going to stop... Then, this book says, you might be an alcoholic. Actually it says you are PROBABLY alcoholic.</span></span></span><br/><span style="-webkit-line-break:after-white-space;"><span style="-webkit-nbsp-mode:space;"><span style="word-wrap:break-word;">And if this is the case then you may have experienced powerlessness over alcohol.</span></span></span><br/><span style="-webkit-line-break:after-white-space;"><span style="-webkit-nbsp-mode:space;"><span style="word-wrap:break-word;">in Chapter 4 (conveniently titled WE Agnostics) on p45 P2 it states:</span></span></span><br/><span style="-webkit-line-break:after-white-space;"><span style="-webkit-nbsp-mode:space;"><span style="word-wrap:break-word;">Lack of power, that was our dilemma, we had to find a power greater than ourselves..</span></span></span><br/><span style="-webkit-line-break:after-white-space;"><span style="-webkit-nbsp-mode:space;"><span style="word-wrap:break-word;">well that's exactly what this book is about:</span></span></span><br/><span style="-webkit-line-break:after-white-space;"><span style="-webkit-nbsp-mode:space;"><span style="word-wrap:break-word;">connecting with this power.</span></span></span><br/><span style="-webkit-line-break:after-white-space;"><span style="-webkit-nbsp-mode:space;"><span style="word-wrap:break-word;">now I'm an agnostic and I have had a spiritual experience as a result of working these steps, and I have not found it necessary to take a drink in over a year and let me tell you this has been one hell of a year.</span></span></span><br/><span style="-webkit-line-break:after-white-space;"><span style="-webkit-nbsp-mode:space;"><span style="word-wrap:break-word;">I often think I might not be done but after doing this work the way that it is outlined in this book I have been able to connect to and rely upon a higher power which has changed my life, my outlook and spirit in ways I cannot explain, qualify or quantify without sounding like an oxyclean commercial.</span></span></span><br/><span style="-webkit-line-break:after-white-space;"><span style="-webkit-nbsp-mode:space;"><span style="word-wrap:break-word;">suffice to say it works.</span></span></span><br/><span style="-webkit-line-break:after-white-space;"><span style="-webkit-nbsp-mode:space;"><span style="word-wrap:break-word;">I OD'd and died on December 9th of 2014. note that this is not my sobriety date. What I mean is this, you don't have to die to relate to this. If you have come back from doing the worst possible thing you can imagine and yet you went and did it again, I get you. I can relate to you and can tell you that I have been given a way of life which has made it possible to turn those horrible experiences into assets in recovery.</span></span></span><br/><span style="-webkit-line-break:after-white-space;"><span style="-webkit-nbsp-mode:space;"><span style="word-wrap:break-word;">that's why I'm here tonight.

I enjoy alcohol, I am probably not done but I have worked this prgram such that I have enough of a reprieve to give that up to God each day and so far I haven't found it necessary to take a drin of a drug on over a year and let me tell you I have been through some shit in the last couple of years.</span></span></span><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><span style="-webkit-line-break:after-white-space;"><span style="-webkit-nbsp-mode:space;"><span style="word-wrap:break-word;">Don't forget God</span></span></span><br/><span style="-webkit-line-break:after-white-space;"><span style="-webkit-nbsp-mode:space;"><span style="word-wrap:break-word;">Get willing</span></span></span><br/><span style="-webkit-line-break:after-white-space;"><span style="-webkit-nbsp-mode:space;"><span style="word-wrap:break-word;">Crumb of willingness</span></span></span></div></span>
