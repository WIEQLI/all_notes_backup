<div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><div>All of the people who are for or against 2nd Amendment</div><div>To those of you who may have had to Kill or Mame or hurt another individual in the defense of your family or your property or your person or to protect the discovery of a lifestyle which could have brought that sort of consequence down upon yourself I believe that the constitution was designed to protect you and keep you safe and I don't think of that type of person as a criminal self defense certainly does not preclude criminal judgement however to mentally unbalanced or perfectly normal people who for whatever reason think that it's okay to Simply murder someone the Constitution protect you the Constitution is designed to give other people the rights to protect themselves from you so I'm sorry if you get the wrong idea about what I think is Criminal behavior in and what should be forgiving but the fact of the matter is the Constitution is designed to protect us from you. To the criminal justice system and the penal system the Constitution should be able to address the issues of how our penal system and our justice system and our whatever you call it how those how regular human beings who are not criminals and yet are subjected to the systems then become indoctrinated and have not really not much of a choice but to become criminals to sustain themselves or to survive we need to fix that it needs to be addressed it needs to be looked at and we need to figure out why we're putting people in jail when we obviously don't we have a reasonable doubt that must be addressed.</div><div><br/></div><div>To the NRA, I do not believe that the constitution especially in the Second Amendment was ever conceived to be in defense of hunting or using Firearms or other weapons in an effort to entertain ourselves. I believe that the 2nd Amendment clearly defines itself in support of the freedom to arm oneself by whatever means necessary to protect oneself from whatever threat may be present at that time and therefore restrictions on Firearms like semi-automatic weapons Etc if they exist outside of our framework and can be used against us then by proxy we should be allowed to use them to defend ourselves. End of f****** story.</div><div><br/></div><div>To</div><div>The issue of abortion I consider to be nearly identical to the issue of drugs and alcohol and caffeine whatever anything and that is that although I may not personally agree with or support a particular thing that you do to your body or your mind it is not my right to tell you not to do it. Now not to be off Lindsay and s*** so I'm going to stand on the court and I'm going to give you my personal experience with the topic of abortion and that is that although I cannot tell you the specifics someone else's situation I must say that I got a woman pregnant who then along with myself we decided to have an abortion and I cannot tell you how horrible I feel about it or how much of a bad decision I believe that was and I've personally against abortion in the case of myself should I ever impregnate someone else again I will I would not support an abortion and I have no way of knowing the impact and I have no way of knowing how I could possibly make an amends to the woman or to this unborn child that you know I was responsible for making that decision I think about it almost everyday sometimes several times a day that it was a regretful decision that I made in my life and even in having that conversation with the other party involved I can't tell you how guilty I feel about being a supporter of abortion in that conversation however it is not that is my experience of my personal experience however it is not my right to tell you the things that you can do with your body and you know there's a philosophy that believes that that fetus is is an autonomous human being however it is my belief and opinion that know being that is dependent upon another being for sustenance or whatever is really an autonomous being and by that way of thinking I would say that even a born child might not be considered by that criteria necessarily an autonomous sentient being I know that the odds are that it will grow into one I know that that's true but I also know that other things and that it happens all the time so I hesitate to say that for instance I'm saying it if you think that the only reason a woman shouldn't have an abortion or rather the only reason a woman could have an abortion in the case of rape or in the case of her body was dying like she was going to die without the abortion I think that's just as much b******* as the argument about hunting for the Second Amendment the thing is it is a person's body because that that woman could or should also be able to make the decision to let herself die in exchange for that child being bored I mean that's a reasonable decision that that woman could make therefore you cannot argue that that is not true. That's secondary tangential argument in Maya. I mean in my opinion</div><div>About the issue of same-sex marriage or just marriage in general I have had an experience with marriage I have been married and I have had an experience with divorce I have been divorced and I will say I'm glad that I got married I think I Married Too Young and I am I am disappointed that I got divorced I think I did that too early as well and I I agree with marriage I think it's something that's important to have but I also but I disagree that marriage is necessarily a right so to speak I mean marriage and like a civil union or a domestic partnership let's call them I don't think they should be the same thing I think that marriage is something that happens in a church because it's a religious ceremony and a right and I don't mean right like alright EHT I mean right like Rite and I also believe that what shirt should not have hold over that definition so if I get married in the Episcopalian Church that's not the same thing as being married in the Jewish synagogue or in the Jewish faith or in the Catholic faith I believe they're different and we should save you know the Civil benefits or the domestic partnership rights they should be available to all people and they should be independent of religion and they should be independent of civil weight which means that a domestic partnership could give you some advantages in other sectors non-governmental sectors like being insured princess and I could have different weight in say you know like taxes or something like that or no not in taxes so I'm saying not in text but in like health insurance or a health insurance or dental plan or in business or in a will something like that those types of legal matters yes civil partnership civil union domestic partnership those things should carry weight at that you're tied to another human being by choice voluntarily however it should not carry weight at the federal level for instance tax taxes two people should not be getting benefits just because they're connected to each other at a federal level for income taxes that's not right I don't see where the connection is there like the federal government is supporting families that doesn't make any f****** sense to me like you're going to give a tax benefits cuz you have a bunch of kids okay dependents okay someone's relying on you okay you write that down on the piece of paper but it's not because I'm married single or I'm a married couple and they're both working and they both have income now they get a tax break or two single people living together don't get a tax break that's complete b******* to me so I mean we're talking about reality I'm not talking about what went before and like what you want to keep around because it existed before that's all I'm talking about I'm talking about taking a look at something today and the way it exist today and think to yourself wait that was wrong before this is right now that's what I'm talking about so you either look at things from reality for where they stand today and that's where we make our decision so if two people are married and they live together in a single home if you have people depending upon you you write it down you have to finish if you have some s*** like that that's going on yeah you write it down and that's tax certainly it's a tax issue to have someone depending upon you absolutely but just cuz they're just as you're married that's b******* so we're looking at what's happening what's on the court and was on the court are you know reality is a landmark thing but basically if it's a speculative</div></span>
