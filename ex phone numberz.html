<div><span><div>Yeah you know some people they get drunk and they drunk dial ex-girlfriends and none of them maybe the drunk dialects employers and leave angry messages not me as I know I've never drunk doubt anybody right eye jump down my ex phone numbers you know like the old phone numbers that you just like to let the bill lapse and then you know eventually Verizon ends up giving the number to somebody else so I called my old phone number you know tell him I miss him they're like what's the matter Dave you need the 2-step Verification code again for my old email accounts I know all the people that have my ex phone numbers except for this one guy one guy has my old business line and for some reason you know even though I'm making good money now and I've tried to buy it back he wants to keep it and he's never forwarded a message that one f****** time this guy never I don't know why I called him and I said it a couple times and he has talked to me and I said hey man if you want I'll just get a new number or I'll even pay you to forward me my messages you know like you know you like 10 bucks every message you for it even if it's just you know somebody I don't want to talk to you or something I get some real interesting messages though I'm like what the fuc I mean can't you send them to me I want to hear them yeah you should try that I'm not kidding one guy who's got my old phone number his name is Gunner and he's he's a nice guy Nevada you know I call him up have like sometimes it a half an hour conversation with with him I never met him but you know he's got my old phone number and then I can't remember the guys name is got my own business line but then there's guy that actually think they have not yet reassigned my original OG phone number that I had for like 20 years I don't know why but maybe cuz I owe them likes $7,000 I should probably go get that back I was one of those lies that had the grandfathered unlimited texts from Verizon before they would cancel it that s*** pisses me off it doesn't cost him anymore to give you unlimited s*** you know it doesn't seem like it should be illegal like a monopoly I mean it's like racketeering there creating the scarcity on purpose to be able to charge you more money that price gouging how's that f****** legal? And can it gives it A New Perspective like I'm not a fan of the way you know Verizon did that put whatever I think you know the Pay It Forward I'm going to just start finding random entrepreneurs that we're like me you know just like couple months behind on their cell phone bill and just pay their bill for my cost in secret and s*** you know all the sudden like $700 bill paid don't worry about that s*** homie need to talk I'm going to lose that number man you've had for like five ten years cost me so much business cuz I lost my number it sucks you know it but you know I just can't keep up and it wasn't like I was doing you know Reckless things for my money that's all you do you know cuz I have to tell you once you start creating your own and you make a living off of it and your whole day your whole existence is is immersed saturated with the process of creation I have to tell you no other kind of Life can compare and just the just the small amount of time or big amount of time that a day job takes away from creating your art it's is heart-wrenching it's really heart-wrenching meant literally you couldn't pay me the thousand dollars a day for me to stop doing art couldn't pay me you couldn't pay me $5,000 a day and maybe you could for like a month but unless I have the freedom of the time to create I don't I don't care I don't want I'll be homeless I honestly I've been happier homeless then unable to create and having money and s*** but like be busy all the time with s*** I don't want to do for some other cat that probably has me doing it some f*****-up way cuz he's not as smart as me you know and even if he's a lot smarter than me and more experienced I don't see it that way so you know that's my experience my experience that I'm working for some dumbass who pays me not enough money to ignore aspect of my life doesn't appreciate it and doesn't really give a f*** cuz he's just some corporate prick that you know Works in some cubicle somewhere over here. You know what I mean like do I build all that up in my head even though it's not true you know probably working for like the undercover the next Andy Warhol metallurgy thing or something but the other thing I was going to say even if they suck you know no that's not true I mean sometimes as an artist I see other artists and I'm like f*** you need to get a day job dude honestly and it's the worst it's the worst thing to hear are from artist to artist you know they came and you know what I think it's time to give up this dream dude you know you're really good at accounting you know and yes I think your parents right at least your parents or your parents don't support your dream you know you can like it really boost you get you like to prove right cuz I know someone who has something to prove can really prove something they can really get it done but like what is like some cat that like you really respect his opinion you should know he's been there and everything and then he says to you man you know yeah I don't know jobs hiring you know and then he's like instead of saying like all you can get a part-time job right and then you know to your heart picks up he's he said something like yeah man you can you know you could be a clerk for a little bit and next thing you know you like that you'll be the manager of the store like he's not even seeing the future of art for you he seen a future of Clerks clerking and as try to remember though what why I went to write this down but the art the creation of art that Eureka moment when you're making something is so powerful and I'm just not prepared oh I know I remember cuz I was talking about you know drug running to know cuz like the cool thing about drug running as it pays really good and you get a lot of time to think and you can you know if you get your system setup you can actually create while you're driving in the car you know you know you could paint you can while you're driving and I was just thinking like you know cuz I've been saying this for a while you know like yeah you know when some drugs here in there I mean s*** I could pay off my phone bill it just just one little one little run cross-country in Bank you know I could pay all that s*** off and you know I can start helping other cats you know funding other artists with my you know illegal activities and then I was thinking right like you know s*** some guy he was like you know some guys call me I'm in these I still do it yeah like the other day some guy in Peoria he was like hey Dave I'll give you $30,000 if you bring me an ounce of you know OG Kush from Humboldt and I'm like f*** yeah of course I would right like why wouldn't you wouldn't you? I mean if I said hey dude go get me some really good cocaine from Colombia. $50,000 is bringing back like an 8-ball I mean what you try it for 50 Grand you know I don't know I don't know if I would actually that's a little different but you know some guys think that it's hit like some guys like you and I just want to be able to tell people that you know that you brought me some weed you know I'm like s*** I need more clients like that you know if these are patrons of the Arts you know let me think about it if you but you know they're not necessarily thinking about supporting you as much as they are thinking about you know the story they can tell their they're buddies you know like Yo dude you'll never guess who's here dude what no yeah right no I had Bill Clinton brought me a hooker yeah I know it wasn't her it was great you know right I brought I don't know they're not artists but like maybe what you call like Bono and you know have him bring over I don't know what's following to you don't call up who else could we support here or we can support I don't know I'm blanking right now on really funny ideas so right some in here. Currently I'm driving in that section of Kansas going west just before you hit Colorado where it's real flat and plain and Bland and it's night time too so I can't I can't even really see what's out there almost looks like the ocean but it's not the ocean it's I think it's just a bunch of grass with some sporadic Evergreens obviously planted by humans because they're well not indigenous for 1 and number number to their put evenly spaced and Rose and probably put their to block out sound or to keep the really nice people of the Midwest from being exposed to those of us that are here hurtling down the road to Breakneck speeds doing any number of unfathomable illegal Acts. And you know I just saw a sign that said attractions next exit or whatever and I'm thinking there definition of attractions is definitely not the same as my definition of attraction it's giving me all these ideas of you know the sideshow Side Road kind of amusements that exist on these roads and how they came about how they evolved to end up being like legitimate tourist destinations without even necessarily being very entertaining at all more like quirky or kitschy or or you know some weird collection of things that nobody really gives a s*** about not even the curator apparently some of these places and their year looking at this collection of alligator teeth or something in that's what happens when you're stuck in a road like this in the middle of nowhere can't see what you know is too boring to look at so just kind of makeup weird s*** and try not to fall asleep and run off the side of the road and kill yourself cuz this part of the country doesn't have guardrails I mean I guess it's not like you really hit anything and this particular section at the worst he could probably happen this but you could hit one of these Bridges I suppose or you know maybe the exit ramps that I have like these big mounds and you might like hit one like it's a ramp and go flying in the air wake up in the air screaming like flying over the nondescript expensive brown grass and then or you might probably would just wake up doing 80 in them bumpy sea of yellow grass I would probably hit one of those pine trees eventually though..  they don't put up a guardrail but you know there's plenty of these hand planted pine trees to run</div></span>
