<span><div>I used to think I understood why the Catholics deem Suicide a mortal sin. I used to think of it like it was God's punishment for someone who had the arrogance to take his own life, to avoid the circumstances or consequences of whatever style of depression had a person so at odds with existence that they would remove themselves from the earth, fro the living,\. </div><div><br/></div><div>I used to think of it as Religion's way or deterring people from taking the easy way out.</div><div><br/></div><div>and then there was Al.</div><div><br/></div><div>Al wasn't quite my sponsor but he was a major part of my first run of sobriety which lasted about 7 years before I found myself with a drink in m y hand one December, out of town at a five star resort having just walked off stage to a packed house and about 10 grand in my pocket. My life was falling apart all around me and If I would have had the balls to dial Al's number that night <a dir="ltr">at 1AM</a>, I'm pretty sure he would have talked me down off of that ledge. I failed to give him that opportunity and instead embarked on a run of bad decisions that left me finally with a storage unit full of anchors and emotional land mines while I was trying to sell the boat I was living on and riding a kid's BMX bike to and from the trolley. I thought that was bottm. I was wrong.</div><div><br/></div><div>But that's another story, suffice to say that during his time I fell out of touch with the recovery community which included Al. Al was a tremendously intelligent and sensitive man. He taught me  what it was like to take men through the steps, he taught me how to walk proudly without having to change my past; to let go of the idea that this was even possible. I think AL was 70 when I met him at my first real AA meeting and at that timehe must have had like 30 years sober. I looked up to him in ways I didn't know were possible until I got sober. His 8th wife Joanne became a confidant and a surrogate mother out here on the West Coast. When Al was starting to have serious health issues he couldn't make it to the meeting we had me tat and used top attend every day, so the men of that meeting deceided to have a meeting at his house  once a week, every thiursday <a dir="ltr">at noon</a>; and I began to see, sometimes to my horror, what it would be like to exit this world and remain sober.</div><div><br/></div><div>Now when I say remain sober I often have to remind myself that Al was in a lot of Pain and he was taking meds that had been prescribed to him by a doctor. I never had an experience with meds in my using days, I think I'd taken two Xanax before I had gotten sober and I had a couple of Tylenol 3's with codeine during a week long stay in a hospital for lyme's disease. I w2as never a downer kind of cat. My poison was booze and coke and I would go go go for weeks sometimes witout sleeping.  I never really understood what it must have been like for Al to be forced to use powerful sedatives and painkillers; meanwhile, maintaining the lifestyle of an otherwise sober man and all that that entails.  He was either the sponsor of , or the grand sponsor of at least fifty men, most of them with double digit sobriety.</div><div><br/></div><div>Al was a powerful force and he carried a message that came with Zero Bullshit added. As near as I could tell he didn't believe in God, he was at the very least an agnostic; but, that never stopped him from praying and it never stopped him from letting you know that God was his solution. That may sound contradictory  dear reader but If you are honest and intelligent and you've spent any legitimate amount of time honestly seeking answers from sages and scriptures, you would have to concede agnosticism. I don't hear enough of that in the rooms.nobody wants to admit they are an agnostic. Hell most people don't even realize what the word means, they all think it's some kind of atheism. which it isn't. Atheism requires the same amount of faith that belief requires. Agnosticism says, I don't know and I probably won't ever know; which to me is the truth.</div><div><br/></div><div>Al was an agnostic. He laid it out pretty simply. &quot;I'm not going to figure it out, pray or don't pray but it seems to be easier if I pray&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>Anyway. I used to think the whole suicide gets you damnation was a kind of a bullshit catch all to keep humans from pulling a lemming run during mass catasprophies until Al committed suicide. And he did it in the shittiest way. I mean we all knew he was in pain. we all knew , or imagined, how fucking hard it must have been to be coming to the end of your life, in constant pain, a former backwoods adventurer and professional dancer who wasn't even gettingout of the apartment more than once a week.  that had to be hell; but, this motherfuclker decided to take hiumself out with a shotgun just after having an argument with his wife while she was in the next room. I mean we're talking marble floors, every dainty knick knack with floor to ceiling windows that over look the entire San Diego Bay.</div><div><br/></div><div>I can't even imagine what a 12 gauge sounds like in an apartment like that; but I know what it looks like. Ive seen wat a point blank shotgun does the a human head, in fact that knowledge is what kept me from doing it to myself about two weeks before I ,et Al; knowing my brother would have been the one to find my body. </div><div><br/></div><div>But this was Al. I remember when I heard the news, through back channels and rumors since I wasn't going to meetings and hadn't been by to see Al or Joanne in maybe a year. I'd pop in when I managed to get a week or two under my belt before heading back out into the jungle because I apparently hadn't lost enough, I still had some more research to do.</div><div><br/></div><div>Joanne was devastaed and rightfully so, they had been in an argument earlier that mornign and I just couldn't get it through my head that Al, a man who had walked hundreds of men through the hardest times in their lives would do something like that.</div><div><br/></div><div>it has been about 2 and a half years since the disease won and he went out on a resentment. I mean truth be told, Al had probably been out there for a while; I mean, Joanne is about the sweetest human being I have ever met. I don't know what kind of mood you'd have to be in to even disagree with her let alone engage in an argument. She 's one of those people who you just can't  to raise her voice above a gently whisper, of course, if there was sonmeone to get your goat, well, that would be Al. He knew how to push buttons; certainly, but man I can't tell you what  kind of feeling that is when someone you admire just straight up falls on his sword like that. Going to a funeral and you don't even know if anyone knows it was a suiciode, nobody can talk about it, nobody gets closure cause nobody wants to be honest about the fucking situation. Al knew this. He knew all of this. He'd probably been to fifty funerals just like it; and still, that petulant bastard couldn't hold on.</div><div><br/></div><div>It was unfathomable to me, this was the guy who answered the unanswerable questions; without an answer of course which is precisely the answer. This is a man who was  a rock of reason in the tempests of trivial, the maelstrom the the myopic, hysterical personal tragedies we all go through. It was inconceivable to me that after 40 years of sobriety and all that wisdom and experience that the disease in the end won him over and he went out on a resentment, leaving his wife to dangle, knowing all that his actions would result in, the family feuding over the estate, the uncertainty of revealing the truth, the bewilderment and disbelief that pervaded each conversation.</div><div><br/></div><div>And every once in a while Joanne checks in on me, shes knows I've had my share of struggles lately; hell everybody knows I've had my struggles. and I just got off the phone with her and she's 's moving a couple of hours away to live with her son. You see Al had money. I don't know how much but certainly he was, hey werte confortable. And joanne took all the guilt and the responsibility on and as a result she washed her hands of the estate I mean the seed doesn't fall far from the tree especially when it comes to cantankerousness. I don't think JHoanny took a die of his setate, I mean I know she s=didn't  and bills are high in that gilded marble mausoleum that overlooks all of San Diego bay and where they spent god knows how myuck money steam cleaning that roomright next to the front dopor where she found his  remains, heart still pumpiong probably. and so we talked and she still feels guilty</div><div><br/></div><div>she even feels guilty for feeling guilty 2 1/2 years later when her family or friends are trying to helpo her move on and she's sleeping every night, just down that hall from that massacre.</div><div><br/></div><div>and I told her how I really felt, that Al was a real asshole. and I can feel her reluctant to agree, loving him still, that asshole</div><div><br/></div><div>and we cried on the phone while I tried to reassure her that what he did was really fucking wrong.</div><div><br/></div><div>and I thought how horrible it must be, spending an eternity hearing the people you love (and love you still) spit out your name, dripping in judgment, lambasting your final action, that irretrievable, indefensible moment, that petulant war cry, cutting through loved ones' hearts because you can't figure out where to slash so that God feels it; ultimately turning the barrel on yourself, desperate to tell God to go to Hell.</div><div><br/></div><div>Oh how I know that feeling, that maneuver, staring down the barrels of my own guns; hoping that this is how you take aim at Him .</div><div><br/></div><div>And I finally get it; why Suicide gets you that trip to hell.</div><div><br/></div><div>I get it. And I'd like to say that youris a cautionary tale; but, I have a sneaking suspicion that I not only get it but I've got it and IO'm not sure how happy I am having to fight it every day for the rest of my life.l Fuck that is so discouraging. I am in awe of the lengths of your endurance; meanwhile still piissed at you </div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>(I didn't know about this. I'm glad you wrote it &amp; talked to Joanne openly like that. Be pissed at his exit because it hurt; Love him for his life because it was an act of love. You know?)</div><div><br/></div></span>
