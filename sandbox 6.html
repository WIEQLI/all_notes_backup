<div><span><div>Is taking me a long time to learn that you can't change other people's behavior least of all when you want to very badly but there are certain keywords or triggers or situations which will keep people from doing some Behavior.  where I was coming from with this has to do with relationships like when somebody asks your opinion about another person and no matter what you advise them they're going to do what they're going to do no matter what however there are certain times when they ask you because they already have a question and if you were to verify confirm or dispute that opinion that they are forming but haven't yet concretely sitting place I feel like that's the only time you could really affect someone else's opinion when someone who looks at you and says do you trust this guy or when they open the ask you for a question or they're trusting you and they've just met you and they're asking about someone else cuz they think you know about those are those tiny little short moments when you have the power to advise them and they might take your opinion into question to a consideration tell me all the time you can really affect somebody is if you're super close known each other a long time and they know that you have their best interest at heart a person who knows how to judge someone else's opinion against what they know and how they know and trust that person two have a steak in the game so to speak like if I ask Sean Hannity a question I have to measure it against all of the beliefs that I know he has so I can trust him to answer my question according to his belief system + his experience + whether or not he gives a s*** about the outcome for me wait against whether or not he thinks it could change an outcome for him once you understand that you can think this way if you have enough information or at least get a statistically favorable response then you know that your own opinion can't really be trusted and if someone else knows you think that way and they think that way it's like the double negative unless you have pure Trust I don't know anybody who has that. And this is why archetypes are important in literature because we use these archetypes to compare classical roles compare classical roles to what should be certain structured relationships in a typical human's life, so Greek archetypes follow certain guidelines and in those guidelines you know there are rules that arise that have to do with things like the roles of a mother and father and a person's life the trust lines so the speaker who should you trust who shouldn't you trust who can you trust to do this and who can you trust to do this who can you trust to act rightly and who I guess the word would be good if we're talking about archetypes because you set up a father so that he can betray someone therein lies the shock of that archetype however we've changed these archetypes through video film constant striving to change the storyline such that Society evolves because we're trying to create something new art literature film anything that the populace sees especially things that are shocking incrementally change the morality and the you know basically the archetype structure of a society however there is a human condition that underlies all of this and sociology pathology of humans that has always been their humans do certain things they always have done them since the beginning of time the difference is that for the majority of our time on Earth humans have not publicly released or scrutinized the statistical information of human behavior versus archetypes so as medium becomes more and more how do I say this because the average human is being exposed to the reality of other humans experiences rather than stories and principles and let's call it moral inclinations that come from books philosophy religion since in film and TV and reality shows we're starting to see that these archetypes are more common or rather more commonly abused or more commonly hard for me to put this in words the more we see an archetype broken in reality the less it becomes a shock and therefore erratic behavior that doesn't fit into the archetypes becomes the norm and our society changes what we believe is moral or right or wrong based upon experience rather than principals handed down to us by culture or our families. However there remains a moral structure which we get from culture families that we learned at a very young age and have difficulty going against it and this is why are you types are important in literature because we use these are types to compare classical rolls compare classical rolls to what should be certain structured relationships in a typical humans life, so Greek Ark types follow certain guidelines and in those guidelines you know there are rules that arise that have to do with things like the Rose of a mother in father and persons life the trust lines so to speak with who should do trust you shouldn't you trust who can you trust to do this and who can you trust to do this who can you trust a act right Lee and who I guess the word would be should if we're talking about target types because you said up a father so that he can betray someone there in lies the shock of that Ark type however we've change these are types through video and film constant striving to change the storyline such that Society of Oz because we're trying to create something new art literature film anything that the popular sees especially things that are shocking incremental eat change the morality and the unit basically the architect structure of a society however there is a human condition that under lies all of this and the sociology pathology of humans that has always been there humans do certain things they always have done them since the beginning of time the difference is that for the majority of our time on earth humans have not publicly</div><div> Dammit the dammit the voice to text thing shut off while I was about halfway through this thing but</div><div><br/></div><div>the roomours</div><div>always longer</div><div>than the affair. a 1</div><div><br/></div><div>&quot;oh!&quot; she said, </div><div>&quot;I found the edge.&quot;</div><div>already falling</div><div>meanwhile falling</div><div><br/></div><div>broken boat, floats</div><div>broken crayon, colors</div><div>broken candle, lights nights</div><div>broken wheel, takes turns</div><div>broken spirit, yearning</div><div>broken heart, still beats</div><div>broken dreams, wakes up sleeping</div><div>broken home, harboring</div><div>moments in time, frozen</div><div>time stopped watching</div><div>and while it kept time</div><div> ticking each click a stop</div><div>each stop eternity</div><div>like death waiting infinite mass</div><div>poised, tipping, silent</div><div>moment umm still going un till the toil</div><div>roots gripping new soil sample</div><div>foil fills the void</div><div>instoid of oil</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>I am not taking it personal</div><div>I'm taking it professional</div><div>it's just that you're an amateur</div><div><br/></div><div>and im near the end of that dance anyway. one of my goals is to be able to sit in a comfortable place of neutrality even when it comes to the use of something terribly addictive. and though this one has been a hard one to reach, i feel like im there.</div><div>shot I lost all that stuff about the girlfriend that I wrote to randy</div><div>Getting sober is like having an ex girlfriend and she still hanging out with all your friends and then eventually they don't call you when they hang out with you and some other s*** but I can't remember what it was but it was really good</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>don't you love it when someone points out how their a professional. That means different things to different people. or when they say, &quot;It's not personal.&quot; That definitely means different things to different people. Taking it personally is when you love coca cola and some guys says &quot;Coke Sucks&quot; and you take it to mean (or they intended to mean ) that ultimately theirin reveals the indication that You personally suck. &quot;Coke Fans Suck&quot; is the kind of statement that is tricky to qualify in the &quot;Professional vs Personal&quot; category dispute. You have to figure out if the person making the statement was indicating whether one condition leads to the other; or, if the two conditions though couincidental , are still always true and if that coincidence is a resyult of some other truth or condition and what that is (obvious or subtle) the way to do this is almost always to determin the statement maker's belief system. oh any this is not an easy thign to do for you must not only uinderstand his belief syustem but  also how he  or she VERIFIES information and even what the definition of Truth is.</div><div>one's evident morality could also be argued to be a determining factor in the valitdity of opinon and also the history of sarcasm or humor in one's diwscourse, or even the likelihood in which two persons might actually meet in person.</div><div><br/></div><div>If I ran into (so and so) I would slap him silly; while, if it were to happen in reality, there is no reasonable expectation that the assault would happen.</div><div>similarly one might make any nummber of proclamations of conditions which are so statistically improbable that these statements are only a vague indication of approval or disapproval in general.</div><div>like, if (famous person) were (near impossible condition) I would (radical action which indicates the speaker's opinion about [famous person] or possibly [radical action]</div><div>nowhere ius this more evident thatn in the game Marry, Fuck, Kill.</div><div><br/></div></span>
