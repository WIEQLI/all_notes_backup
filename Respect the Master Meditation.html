<span><div>it has become clear that there must be a focus, a pointed direction. I have not been paying the proper respect. I have not been setting an intention; only seeking recreational stimulation and being safe by not committing to an intention, not putting it on the line. It seemed frivolous probably but it was actually cowardly and I admit it freely</div><div><br/></div><div>there must be a mediation of respect prior to embarkation</div><div><br/></div><div>the thing that I have been forgetting each time is the confusion that descends immediately. the clinical and cartoon-ish world which has been the only thing available to me; I'm assuming, because I haven't been honest nor mature about the spirit. I remembered in my last excursion these feelings of empty rooms and pixelated when I made a declaration to focus my intention, I was given a little gift of perception. I learned the Inner Ear Exercise which I will detail somewhere else. I must point this tool in a direction and wield it if I am going to use it at all and although I haven't been doing that, it is my intention to do that from now on. this is my meditation in writing, that I will show respect to the teacher. I make this declaration of respect symbolically and literally by offering my will, my breath, my life, my intention to be a student not for the sake of gaining knowledge but o be of service to the teacher and to follow with curiosity, all directions, all instructions, and to keep an open mind and heart.</div><div><br/></div><div>later 180324, I think I wrote that back in 2017, yeah July 20th, 2017, now 2/3rds of a year later and I have not really done this, only a few times, like once when I was trying to figure out the problem with the psychosis and asked Dimitri to help me with that but I can't remember if that was the time when  but I got flooded with a gnarly trip that was like punching me in the face with suggestion; so eitherthat problem is accessible in some way or an outside force knew that it's manipulable.and I forgot the inner ear exercise that i was tralking about I'll lhave to look it up, it muist have been back in July, I can't remember what that was, I hope I wrote it down somewhere. I'm also not sure why this is in the AA topics folder because I was referring to the practice of exploring with my friend Dimitri, of course lately Dimitri has been showing me a different side of himself, it used to feel friendlier and now it almost feels downright adversarial which is difficult to maintain an open mind to.</div><div><br/></div><div>I can hear the snippets of conversations with family members who seem to be trying to guide or force me into something. It is my opinion that there are a couple of possibilities and in no particular order they are</div><div><br/></div><div><ol start="1"><li><span style="line-height: 1.45;">My family is part of some diabolical scheme to do something to me or for me, however derived, it is diabolical if true</span></li></ol></div><div><br/></div><div><ol start="3"><li><span style="line-height: 1.45;">A foreign (unknown), cognizant force is utilizing technology which is known to exist to complete an experiment using recordings of my family or voice synthesis software (which exist) to manipulate or demonstrate a type of behavioral modification</span></li><li><br/></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.45;">I'm just going crazy and experiencing psychosis or  encroaching schizophrenia.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.45;">some combination of these</span></li></ol></div><div><br/></div><div>I'm no psychiatrist but here is a tiny portion of what I have observed</div><div><br/></div><div>there are times when certain voices are prevalent. They are ususally familiar to me or intentional obscured, meaning they either sound justlike my brother or my mother or my dad or they sound like that hacker voice on movies. People who use signal application for both phone calls and text do not tend to be in my psychosis.</div><div><br/></div><div>I experiment by doing a variety of actions and weighing the voices against what I think they would say if they were actuality attached to the people I have an experience with. It seems as though this is carefully curated, along with the TV, and even Internet advertisements.</div><div><br/></div><div>I got the idea to test it a few years ago. I would play angel devil games with myself and figure out the difference between my inner voice questioning and my inner voice knowing and my kniowing inner voice being wrong. with some interesting results.</div><div> recently I have been experiencing a surge of activion and difference in outcome than I thought I would experience.</div><div><br/></div><div> unusual things like my right thumb which is going numb on the pad side. I seem to have a cut there, I noticed the numbness after using the scissors to cut through many pages at once; though, there's a little cut there and a bruise so I wonder what that's all about. I also have noticed since I have been doing shower yoga that my middle toes experience sharp pains while stretching on the top like the metatarsal ligaments are shrinking or some thing, it is very painful to kneel japanese style with my feet flat under me. but just in the middle toe of each foot, I first noticed it on the left and then the right.</div><div><br/></div><div>I also wonder if after discovering at least 20 times that what is happening to me is not my perception but an actual targeted situation that I forget easily and am led astray by all sorts of distractions. And when I get angry or blow up, it seems to be the goal, as in I am led to anger and that flash of emotion is their goal. Who are they? well they could be anyone who wants to try out an experiment on an actual human who wouldn't be believed if they raised a bullshit flag. I would have told you that I wa a bad choice for this but apparently they have chosen well since not even my family believes that I am experienceing this</div><div>or</div><div>they are led to believe that by pretending that it is not happeneing that it is somehow helpful to me or them or something, it really doesn't make any sense; yet, it is impossible to say that I am making this up; unless, I have a poultiple personality disorder that happens simultaneoisly, e one half of myt brain is fucking with the other half of my brain.</div><div><br/></div><div>my smoke alarms have gone off, my co2/explosive gas alarm beeps all the time so I have stopped plugging it in. I had it right next to my butane lighter andit didn't go off but it could be gases from this location. I don't think it is from anything I am doing but I can test that</div><div>just not at 3am</div><div>\</div><div>other things I have notice about the &quot;psychosis&quot; is that it tends to have an objective and frequently changes which direction it is going. almost like an interrogation where y reactions are weighed like a hybrid lie detector, chemical and logical puzzle which encourages me to solve it, only at the end of the trail is an accusation or an implied wrongdoing. it's very strange how sometimes it seems like it's just one guy or two guys and on other times it's like it's a ton of people, sometimes even crowds booing or cheering as I fumble through the &quot;dream&quot; sometimes they talk to me, sometimes they talk about me, today one guy was on the phone talking about it like he was pissed he had to be here. some of them are insidious and psychopathic  like they get joy from the &quot;research&quot; while others offer insight which only make it scarier because how can you tell the difference? and some of them are pretty cool and sometimes they switch on a dime, sometimes they act as though they are able to do me physical harm and once, I was even led to believe that aI was being radiated&quot; by a wifi signal oo phone signal generator. and trust that I know how ridiculous this sounds</div><div><br/></div><div>I had four or five doctors set up to meet with me on the regular and then I go to myu appointment and it had been canceled. of course I can't remember if I discussed that with her, I mean I remember a discussion while I was in the hospital, I just don't remember her saying she was going to cancel the appointment obviously cause i even showed up early top the appoointment. That ought tot ell yuou something right thtrere.</div><div>'cause I never do that.</div><div>If the nurse had canceled the appointment  strange that I  haven't heard back from her since.</div><div><br/></div><div>One thing I'm sure of is that I was in the hospital and I had a doctor Rao. who has done a paper on the ease of diagnosis from within the structure of inpatient situations as opposed to outpatient I guess, I was going to ask him about that when I met him for the appointment that was canceled.</div><div><br/></div><div>I have been taking a prescription of risperadone 2mg per day, with acyclovir and of course I've maintained my regular other regiment of stimulant, not great diet but not losing weight, not much exercise but yoga/stretching regularly. I have some shame issues with some of my behavior and it often feels as thogh this &quot;gauntlet&quot; is somehow related to that. which brings me to the question of motive.</div><div><br/></div><div>and man that is a question hich has plagued me, not because i don't see one, rather beai see many of them where others don't , even when I explain it; which, is as disturbing to me as it probably is to them.</div><div><br/></div><div>it is possible that because of my online presence and meantions of bitcoin et al. that an intelligent entity has constructed a software-based program which has selected me as a probable holder of a large some of weeither money or intellectual property due to postings which, like many of my work is meant to be taken several ways and be true in all of them. Maybe not for me but certainly for some people. that is how I write. with multip[ple angles to include things that aren't necessarily true gfor me but are true for others. I poersonally haaaaaaaaaaaaaav great success in crypotocurrencies if you look at them from the stabndpoint of percentages. Unfortunatley m,y initial botcoin investment was only 200 dollars which I doubled, then, if I had left it there, would have maybe netted me a total of 4000 at it's highest point but unfortunatley I kept p[ulling money out to pay bills and cover expenses and I think I have a total of 1000 doallars in an account I can no longer get into because Coinbase is such a pain in the ass with the ID and my name having a JR at the end of it. For some reason they won't accept my ID even thought it is the exact same one I signed up with. I can't tell you how many hours I've wasted on trying to get this money out. Not only that, but if it had broken much earlier, I would have had gone from $200 to $4000 in the space of about a year, instead I paid a couple of months rent and went to a festival. either way  my instincts were right and that was a great opportunity which I missed . But, someone might think I didn't miss that and they might be trying to use advanced technology to coerce myself and others into giving away passwords etc...</div><div><br/></div><div>second this opens up the idea of Identity and bitcoin  if you could get someone's passwords, well you could very well do the same thing and steal their identity and make huge transactions through crypto-currency without being responsible for taxable gains.  I was call this bot-coin but it looks like someone else has already names it that because it is showing up my spell checker suggestions. which is interesting because Crypt-ocurrency doesn't show up in my spell checker suggestions, either do many contractions like don't or wasn't</div><div><br/></div><div>similarly I've noticed changes even in professionalspeaker's diction.</div><div><br/></div><div>there are so many things to outline</div><div>I'll try not to sound crazy.</div><div>but it's like being interrogated when you have no idea what the law is,</div><div><br/></div><div>I mean imagine if you are a cannibal and in your country you can eat people, and then you go to the US and they haul you in and start asking you questions and you're like w this about</div><div>and they've got the lights and the big gus in the corner and you're in a jail cell and the guys says, &quot;<span style="line-height: 1.45;">just answer the question&quot;</span></div><div><span style="line-height: 1.45;">and you say, &quot;wait, </span><span style="line-height: 1.45;">isn't there a law in this country that says you don't have to testify against yourself?&quot;</span></div><div>they say &quot;yes but ignorance of the law is no excuse.&quot;</div><div>you say &quot;exactly, and you shouldn't be allowed to let me break your own rules&quot;</div><div>and they pack up the light and say, &quot;you're free to go&quot; we were never here</div><div>and where does one get justice in a situation like that?? These guys aren't even in an agency. They could tell you of course...</div><div>and they wouldn't have to kill you</div><div>cause no one would believe you.</div><div>and not being believable might kill some people cause they might call 911 for nothing and end up in a place where their soul would die before the body did.. running around, scared, manic, harangued, significant unexplained memory problems, unable to make a good argument that lasts longer then 5 minutes, because you gotta gathering facts,</div><div><span style="line-height: 1.45;">yeah they're fast</span></div><div><span style="line-height: 1.45;">like cats on a leash,</span></div><div><span style="line-height: 1.45;">yeah, you got it tied up</span></div><div><span style="line-height: 1.45;">but getting and </span>forgetting</div><div><span style="line-height: 1.45;">used to be different</span></div><div><span style="line-height: 1.45;">and giving and fore-giving used to be different</span></div><div><span style="line-height: 1.45;">thank you lisa,</span></div><div><span style="line-height: 1.45;">trying to explain to your own Dad that you can't even tell him what you've experienced because it scares</span><span style="line-height: 1.45;"> him so much he gets angry enough</span><span style="line-height: 1.45;"> to make you think he thinks you're a crazy drug addicted ______ fill in the blank.</span></div><div>meanwhile you achieve a ratio of capable/unsuccessful that is getting closer to one</div><div>unmatched yet in your entire life</div><div>and worst in that list</div><div>you can't seem to explain </div><div>to anyone other than</div><div>maybe your mom,</div><div>that the drug may make you pathetic</div><div>but to call it the cause</div><div>would be inauthentic.</div><div>and your momma didn't raise no sucker,</div><div>your momma raised one sucker</div><div>no offense Dougie, I'm just trying to figure out which one of us it isn't</div><div>you can be a genius, and still love a lolly</div><div>cause there's a flavor born every minute.</div><div>sometimes you gotta say sorry, but I still gotta check for the wire</div><div>and other times you just have to sit and wonder if this is all Stephen Hawkin's idea of a practical joke in retaliation for mispelling his name</div><div>&quot;Gee&quot; I wonder if I should have put a question mark there.</div><div>how many meanings is that?</div><div>what's another reverse euphemism for smoking?</div><div>not meant to be grandiose sir</div><div>but how can small be more than bigger?</div><div>when it is the one</div><div>that works until you fracture it</div><div>like science</div><div>subatomic structure the structure under the sandbox we're in</div><div>Particle of the question I hadn't think to asking</div><div>so we sandbox yeah?</div><div>all our everything belong to us</div><div>love pwnticle</div><div><br/></div><div>I just came up with this idea of a type of singing call and response but you make it challenging such that the song can only be completed by the listener.</div><div><br/></div><div>like in the previous rhyme there are questions</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></span>
