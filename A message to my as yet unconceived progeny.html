                <div>This is a message to my as yet I'm conceived progeny, I do hope that you have the patience to bear with me no I have not yet for children I'm hoping that someday I'll be able to pass this note on in person and I imagine that you are greater than me more intelligent more refined more able to access the inner so the inner mind to know the difference between thinking and feeling and actions and that of all the qualities I adore the one that I think it's the most important is stubbornness though I would not let you know this until you're much stubbornness is the only way anything ever gets done the willingness to hold onto an idea or concept of thought process long past its benefit to you it's how we come up with the Myriad of permutations which have us one day striking Eureka in a perfect balance of fragile combination that creates a magnetic electrical momentum that could not have been conceived or thought of prior to your unrelenting unwillingness to stop testing the boundaries of our current ideas and beliefs we're not for this stubbornness nearly every single advance in human development would have not occurred were it not for this persistence to live life on our own terms we would not have really gotten anywhere I mean we as a species are so stubborn that we have anthropomorphised physical Natural Forces into a being which we can blame because it isn't going on way simultaneously used that being justified and the number of irrational ideas and then should we be successful we get to decide whether it or we take the credit all one has to do is to watch one man dancing and one man getting to his knees in the endzone On Any Given Sunday to see this in action. And the extent to which you agree or feel disdain when watching these celebrations it's the extent to that stubbornness exist within you some of us are stubborn to keep things the way they've been and some of us are stubborn to make things change either one is equally responsible for the awesomeness of our species we need them both unfortunately we need them both or fortunately we need them both unfortunately we cannot see that we need them both so we still can meet them both. So each time that it may have seen like I was trying to break your will to subjugate you to force you into compliance with my system it was summer taneously an exercise and practical training for both of us and our species and our society and our planet an exercise in growing an exercise in enduring pain and an exercise in exalting and love and the Supreme joy of the Eureka moment and the thrill of victory post against the consequence of defeat and also the consequences of victory and the thrill of surrender he's all exist these all exist in permutations of an unknowable multitude somewhere in the neighborhood of infinity. So who may or may not have met me and who may or may not exist that is also unknowable to the magnitude of infinity In This Moment which I am dictating this into some primitive to you yet wildly technologically-advanced to me device and I've come to the conclusion that you need to know if you think about where you come from I don't really even know where we come from soon as I get some money together I'm going to go take one of those DNA tests and maybe I'll go see that guy that looks up your whole family just y'all about yourself a song on NPR I watch them all the time actually but I do know a few things my mother's maiden name is Patrone my father's is Williams and you come from a long line of tough motherfukers and attractive motherfukers your great-grandfather my grandfather both of them are hard-working men really tough considered to be an a****** by many even his own family but he was also fessional athlete a professional Soldier a newspaper man and from what I understand he knew how to fight and he was talented he can sing they could dance and he had at least five kids that I know of married twice his name was Ralph Patrone his father was I was told the mayor of Atlantic City but I've looked it up and nothing is true he was somebody though councilman because President Reagan said congratulations on his 80th birthday or maybe it was his 50th wedding anniversary that they read it at the party the family there and I remember now wondering why I didn't think it was unusual for a president to be sending a letter to some guy on his anniversary of his wedding but knowing what I know now Atlantic City and of the 1980s well it all kind of makes sense he was also rumored to have been a world champion boxer presumably of the flyweight lightweight division he had and love and the the Supreme joy of the Eureka moment and the thrill of Victory post against the consequence of the feet and also the consequence of Victory and this real of surrender these all exist these all exist in fermentation Savannah Noble multitude somewhere in the neighborhood up Infiniti so do my project approved may or may not have met me and who may or may not exist that is also a noble to the magnitude of Infiniti in this moment which I am dictating this into some primitive to you yet wow the technologically advanced to me device end of come to the conclusion that you need to know if you think about where you come from I don't really even know where we come from them soon as I get some money together I'm going to go take one of those DNA test and maybe I'll go see that guy that looks up your hope family does y'all about yourself I saw I'm on NPR I watch him all the time and but I do know if you think you're grand my mothers maiden name is patron my father's Williams and you come from a long line of tough motherfukers attractive months boys and girls your grandmother very beautiful woman the grandfather good-looking men and they came together they were neighbors across the street from each other and as good-looking men and good-looking women are occasionally known to do they had a child that child was me now back in those days it wasn't a good idea to have a child if you weren't married and I don't know how it is in the day which you're listening to this but I hope I'm not speeding let's meeting back to the store I mean that's what cruise control is for voice recognition for you is probably way better than this for us especially since I have a different accent than most people and it makes it kind of an arduous task to sit there and go over this stuff while I'm worried about a police car coming up behind me and pulled me over anyway trying to get back to what I was saying before I could just record it and then like set it off to some transcription service and have them transcribe it into text for me but I don't really know what that entails so plus it might be really interesting to see what kind of put the misspellings and whatever the word is for when somebody misunderstands the sentence that you said and turn into a different sentence it might be really interesting what kind of ideas I can get out of that sort of blunder I'm going to have to start recording this cuz this voice to text thing keeps like stopping when and it won't make a noise that it stopped to tell me that's not doing it anymore so it's really pissing me off cuz I get these great dissertations that I think the voice to text thing is actually writing down here in fact it's not writing down s*** and why we have cars today model car it don't have microphones and other types of equipment in them cameras videotaping us while we drive and for our own archival purposes I don't understand why I spend basically like 3 years worth of rent for a vehicle that in this days that age doesn't have four cameras recording devices unlimited amount of storage with Cloud connection I just don't get it I can spend you know basically half a month's rent on a thing I hold in my hand it does all these things but this card that I have because you know 3 years worth of rent doesn't have a single camera to record my experience or audio or all kinds of s*** and cell phone has why why is that I don't get it an active Sun blocking technology and I like what the f*** why can't they figure that out a little thing that's a text which direction the sun is coming and how to block it from the driver's face I mean are you f****** kidding me why haven't they figure this s*** up</div>
