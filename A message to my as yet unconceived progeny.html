This is a message to my as yet I'm conceived progeny, I do hope that you have the patience to bear with me no I have not yet had children, I'm hoping that someday I'll be able to pass this note on in person and I imagine that you are greater than me; more intelligent, more refined, more able to access the inner mind, to know the difference between thinking, feeling and actions; and, that out of all the qualities I adore the one that I think it's the most important is stubbornness; though, I would not let you know this until you're much older. Stubbornness is the only way anything ever gets done. The willingness to hold onto the intended outcome of an idea, concept or thought process; long past its benefit to you, it's how we come up with the Myriad of permutations which have us one day striking Eureka in a perfectly balanced combination that creates a magnetic electrical momentum that could not have been conceived or thought of prior to your unrelenting unwillingness to stop testing the boundaries of our current ideas and beliefs. Were it not for this stubbornness, nearly every single advancement in human development would have not occurred. Were it not for this persistence to live life on our own terms we would not have really gotten anywhere; I mean, we as a species are so stubborn that we have anthropomorphised physical natural Forces into a being which we can blame because it isn't going our way, simultaneously used that being to justify any number of irrational ideas and then, should we be successful, we get to decide whether it or we take the credit. All one has to do is to watch one man dancing and one man getting to his knees in the endzone On Any Given Sunday to see this in action. And the extent to which you agree or feel disdain when watching these celebrations it's the extent that stubbornness exists within you. Some of us are stubborn to keep things the way they've been and some of us are stubborn to make things change. Either one is equally responsible for the awesomeness of our species we need them both; fortunately or unfortunately this creates unrest in our communities. So, each time that it may have seen like I was trying to break your will to subjugate you to force you into compliance with my system; it was simultaneously an exercise and practical training for both of us and our species and our society and our planet; an exercise in growing, an exercise in enduring pain and an exercise in being fully engaged in Supreme joy of the Eureka moment. and the thrill of victory pitted against the consequence of defeat; and, also the consequences of victory, and the unexpected freedom of surrender. These all exist in permutations of an unknowable multitude somewhere in the neighborhood of infinity. So, who may or may not have met me and who may or may not exist that is also unknowable to the magnitude of infinity In This Moment while I am dictating this into some primitive-to-you yet wildly technologically-advanced to me device; and, I've come to the conclusion that you need to know. if you think about where you come from, I don't really even know where we come from, soon as I get some money together I'm going to go take one of those DNA tests and maybe I'll go see that guy that looks up your whole family (?just y'all about yourself a song on?) NPR I watch Him all the time actually but I do know a few things my mother's maiden name is Patrone my father's is Williams and you come from a long line of tough motherfuckers and attractive motherfuckers; your great-grandfather my grandfather both of them are hard-working men really tough considered to be an asshole by many even his own family; but, he was also a professional athlete, a professional Soldier, a newspaper man and from what I understand he knew how to fight and he was an extremely talented dancer and singer. He had at least five kids that I know of married twice his name was Ralph Patrone his father was I was told the mayor of Atlantic City; but, I've looked it up and I don't think that's true; however, he was somebody in government though, a councilman maybe, because President Reagan said congratulations on his 80th birthday maybe it was one of those things you request.  They read it at the party, with the family there and I remember now wondering why I didn't think it was unusual for a president to be sending a letter to some guy on his birthday; but, knowing what I know now of Atlantic City then; well, it all kind of makes sense he was also rumored to have been a world champion boxer, presumably of the flyweight division or something like that. I don't know much about boxing; but, we make good atheletes. 
My mother and father were neighbors across the street and they found out my motherr was pregnant my dad had gone off to college. In those days it wasn't a good idea to have a child if you weren't married and I don't know how it is in the day which you're listening to this but I hope I'm not speeding let's put my foot back on the floor, I mean that's what cruise control is for, voice recognition for you is probably way better than this for us especially since I have a different accent than most people and it makes it kind of an arduous task to sit there and go over this stuff while I'm worried about a police car coming up behind me and pulling me over, anyway, trying to get back to what I was saying before , I could just record it and then, like, send it off to some transcription service and have them transcribe it into text for me but I don't really know what that entails; so plus it might be really interesting to see what kind of misspellings and whatever the word is for when somebody misunderstands the sentence that you said and turn into a different sentence... it might be really interesting. what kind of ideas I can get out of that sort of blunder. I'm going to have to start recording this cuz this voice to text thing keeps like stopping when and it won't make a noise that it stopped to tell me that's not doing it anymore so it's really pissing me off cuz I get these great dissertations that I think the voice to text thing is actually writing down here in fact it's not writing down shit, and why we have cars today, modern car, it doesn't have microphones and other types of equipment in them, cameras videotaping us while we drive; and, for our own archival purposes. I don't understand why I spend basically like 3 years worth of rent for a vehicle that in this day that age, DOESN'T have four cameras, recording devices, unlimited amount of storage with an unlimited Cloud connection. I just don't get it. I can spend you know basically, half a month's rent on a thing I hold in my hand, it does all these things, but this car that I have; because, you know, 3 years worth of rent doesn't have a single camera to record my experience or audio or all kinds of shit, and cell phone has everything. why? why is that? I don't get it, it should have an active Sun blocking technology built into the windshield and Im like what the f*** why can't they figure that out a little thing that detects which direction the sun is coming from and how to block it from the driver's face. I mean are you f****** kidding me why haven't they figure this shit ou
