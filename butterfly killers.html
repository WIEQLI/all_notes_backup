<div><span><div>there was a butterfly, i think maybe I was the butterfly and the butterfly landed in s bouquet but it was a trap and in the bouquet there was mlokecsxrsgl some kind of thing. Predator I want to say insect or snale but it looked like a tag, like a greeting card or a flag or something,  attached to the flowers if liked like the flag or Maryland to me almost like a long chevron while with red inside it and if was, seemed like an auto trigger swatting thing that was meant to scare birds away</div><div>And when the butterfly flew up and landed on the flowers it like flapped down like it was on some kind of sensor thing in the butterfly kind of moved sideways and look like was trying to get out of the flowers and then flap down again but like in the dream I was just behind the butterfly like I don't know I can't remember and I realized as this thing kept flapping at the butterfly that it was some kind of spider or insect but I got the feeling that it was more than that that like it wasn't even an actual thing but an embodiment of  evil and as brutal as this world really is! I am writhing in my seat just remembering it. That insane Panic that you feel when your life is really on the line. Like when you know that if you don't do the right thing this other organisms going to kill you . though okay was a part of the organism and it had all been designed to trap matches me there but then I got the feeling that it was not just the butterfly but I got the feeling that it was designed to trap me to like I was sending the butterfly to the flowers and the thing seem like it wanted the butterfly at first which is weird cuz I would never send a butterfly to a spider's web but it's like I was tricked into it but that thing really wanted me and so I was like supposed to help the butterfly and then this thing was actually coming from me and that's when I woke up.</div><div>But then I was thinking that I have had this dream before the thing with the flag it was like an upside down Chevron but long like the curves were the same but just farther apart in one piece if you spread like the if you had a Corporal Chevrons and you took the bottom of the top one and you spread them apart so you had like two inches between the top one of the bottom I don't know what you call that shape butt it was like a flag like like underneath it was black and yellow but like up top it was kind of white with some red in it and it seemed to technical to be natural like a flag it seems like it was drawn on there and such a way that you would think it was like the opposite of nature how nature would use camouflage to make it seem normal in nature this was camouflage to make it seem mechanical and therefore not dangerous weird. </div><div><br/></div><div>I'm trying to remember what down what went down before this it was some kind of big ship I'm going to say Battleship or I mean in aircraft carrier but I could teleport under the ship but it wasn't like I was really doing it it was kind of like I could conceptually do it but my body and actually do it but for some reason people believe that I was actually doing even I believe that some point that I was doing it I don't know it's strange how that happens strange how things happen in dreams if you saw any other time you would say that's completely absurd and I would like to figure out or spend some time with those people who believe that the dream is reality and that this reality is just a dream I mean I get that that's the Hindu thing this Maya illusion but they're so spiritual Masters that aren't Hindu that believe this and I have like to know who they are next time I hear it I want to remember it so I can go talk to them.</div><div>Anyway I'm trying to figure out what it was I was doing before it turned into this bouquet of flowers I was going somewhere and I turn to my right and I saw someone like a woman tremendously beautiful and I was with someone else and he made a cat call and I said no man that's not how you do it and then if you got just a little further there was a guy that was going to her with flowers he had cut flowers in a bouquet and in that bouquet I was thinking like no man you don't cut the flowers and I had this like vision of throwing flowers back into this Garden of Flowers and then we're all bright and vibrant and like carnations and daisies feels Gerbera daisies pastels and like real Carnation red not all of them just the one that one that was like right up front and it seem like I got really small and I was in this bouquet but the butterfly was in front of me and I don't know why and I saw the tag kind of stick it up over the flowers and then when it made its first flap I was thinking oh it's just trying to keep the butterfly off the flowers but it didn't occur to me like why would you want to keep a butterfly off of flowers it was a Viceroy or Monarch I always get confused which one is which but it also had like the blue in it I doubt that the actual type of butterfly is important but I can't put together all the stuff that was going on in the dream do remember being like horrified at the end like I've been tricked and it was like a big deal like I was going to die kind of tripped and then I had brought others to also be killed because I didn't see that it was a trick and some wondering if that's what's happening around me in my life right now I can understand trepidation from my current business Endeavor because zip of the possibility of people in power whoever they may be IRS government police politics like what shity deal it would be if this was how they figured out where all the farmers were so they can lock it down turn it around and make it legal or illegal and then lock everybody down they didn't big know where everything once after that so I wonder if I should be on the other side keeping people quiet and in the underground distribution train we're going legit is the answer for these farmers I don't know it's a good plant there's nothing wrong with it it's way better than alcohol it's it has more potential than all the others stimulants down or whatever it's it's interesting in that it has all these properties and different strains have different properties and it's so much safer from what I can see and from what I felt then all these other chemicals. It will be really f***** up if this was just a plan, and I'm not paranoid I'm f****** highly intelligent this is the kind of plan I would think of if I wanted to f*** everybody over which I don't but I can see how people might think like that you know just get behind the movement just enough to get some segments of the population to to vote who they know won't vote later I mean who knows who's going to vote after Donald Trump like people could go throw their hands up in the air and go this whole system is f***** why would I waste my time why would I bother or people could I have the whole opposite reaction and be engendered by does Donald Trump thing and you know want to get involved and participate and rally voters Etc. Anyway these are all things that I've been considering among others, plus having to deal with another upcoming trial of you no physical trial to kick it's going to f****** suck this time I've been weaning I'm going to need Christian help I might need to do an ibogaine cleanse or something cuz there's just for some reason that particular chemical work so well with my body that when I don't have it anymore I really really get f***** for like a week I mean really bad it just seems weird cuz I don't know any other people that experience that kick. I get the electric sleep in the electrocutions crawling in my skin that vertical upside down vertigo can't find up or down feeling it's like being dizzy but add pins and needles to my whole body semicolon and that goes on for about a week before I start to feel normal but if I can stay in that middle ground that has been a danger this whole time I've never been one of those guys they can hang out in the middle ground. Anyway </div><div> it's all coming to a head here in the next couple of days maybe a week but I want to be very conscious of deception. </div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></span>
