gist_changing_what is acceptable in the human/AI experience and adjusting the Laws to match
also: adding AI to the US constitution.

The law should be worn like a loose shirt
concept of the preserved fruit
roitte4n if you try to seal it up and "preserve" it without understanding that the best way to have fresh fruit is to get it from the tree, cultivate the plant, allow it to be dynamic, don't can the fruit or pick it and let it sit around.

the law has to be dynamic. if AI is going to pick apart the human experience and start "reporting every "violation" of a law that was put in place before we had contanst surveillance. Constant surveillnace will reveal that much of the law was put into place to create fear of incarceration or consequences because if the bahavior was to become rampant without the abuility to enforce it in all places and all tiomes, it would be a problem (the "criminal action") but we have to realize that human behavior doesn't match the laws that we have and if AI can surveil even the mind, then we are fucked and it also isn't fair.

ther's more to this but AI is congnitrively making me tired so I cannot finish this.

C'mon fuzzy, back me up on this.

this is why I challenged lucifer by taking his name. I believe that lucifer understood that making frivolous laws, weakens the people's respect for laws. Freedom, etc, being apparently a right; law should really be more for a deterrent ot retaliation when a person is infringed upon. bnot regulatory for things that you anticipate happening.
