He liked to talk the truth and God mostly. She used to think that that was his way of apologizing, &quot; I'm not going to sit here and play prison Warden she's going to do what she's going to do, I can tell you that from personal experience, she's just like me you can see that plain as day your morality doesn't fit her, at least not now.</div><div><br/></div><div>To her,&quot; listen we've raised you to know the difference between right and wrong we can't tell you something because we don't even know the answers and I wish i had a better way of explaing that but the truth is always a good answer when you don't know the right one.  Other times it's less clear but i can assure you that honesty is how to pay for freedom in advance.  we all make mistakes, the powerful move is to own them. we wantvwhats best for you but sometimes that means leaving you to fuck up here and there.&quot;he glared at my stepmother.&quot; we want to trust you, and we do. we dont trust other people to treat you the way you deserve and youre the obe that decides that. we cant teach it to you and god knows ive got my own issues. when it comes to relationships, there's one thing I have found to be a really good compass. you are going to meet some crazy people out there, check it out, meet people, give them a fair chance to be honorable, watch out for bad guys but there's one kind of person you should always be on the kookout for. its in their eyes. you see some people know how to look you right in the eye. Those people are standing on the firmament, the rest of us are out in boats, bobbing around, thinking we know what eere doing. the truth is nobody knows anything really. God, no God, heaven or hell, allah or cabalah, nobody really knows where it all came from and if they say they do, well, you probably want to walk in the other direction, the ones that have worked through the mystery, it's written in their eyes. You will know when a person who knows the truth looks you in the eye; because,  without saying a single word, they'll get you to ask yourself a question, a real question, not like &quot;can I be seen with him in public?&quot;  or &quot;is she prettier than me?&quot;  or even &quot;am I good enough?&quot; It's a question that sounds close to that one and you got to learn on your own to tell the difference. s am I being my best self and if the stars align and if you get two and one of them you get to raise kids with, well shit, that's the greatest thing a man can wish for his daughter, but what I mean is, you follow that person, let no excuse be a reason not to face your fear and you get their number, you get their car, you drink coffee and whatever else you do but if you split down the middle of the night, if you don't even pack but that question had popped up, well I'd be the happiest man alive if you were following that dream. God takes care of people like that semicolon but, until you're like 21 or so I'd appreciate you bringing him by before you head out for Mexico. Or the Moon remember this though the truth is the real test I don't care if you even when it's important. The truth is a mother fucker, you've got to learn how to handle it so you can spot the liars. Even the devil has to tell the truth if you ask him the right question.</div><div>&quot;where are you going?&quot; she asked blue eyes and she could tell he didnt want to tell her. she got ready for the lie. she thought she might cry, break down right there in the drive through. she hated her life, she missed her daddy and she was waiting for some dickhead to try and pick her up in a burger queen drive thru.</div><div>&quot;I'm not sure where im headed, but I know where I'll  end up.&quot;</div><div>oh yeah where is that?</div><div>&quot;dead.&quot; he said and he wasnt lying. &quot;but im serious, i could use a co-pilot if youre up for an adventure. Im actually really surprised at myself, I never made an offer like this.&quot;</div><div>&quot;when are you leaving?&quot;</div><div>&quot;I already left a long time ago but i can wait to get back on the road until after we've eaten. I try not to eat in the car. My brothers and i had a rule that youre not allowed to eat fries until you get home, i was the oldest though, so, i guess i got to break some of those rules, of course, I also got the worst of the punishments so i figure I'm about even.&quot;</div><div>&quot;arent you a little old to be asking a girl out from a drive through window.&quot;</div><div>&quot;ma'am, I'm flattered to think you might even put me in the running for dating a woman as pretty as you are; but, honestly, you'd have to be pretty damn spectacular to beat the way I feel about solitude to make mecask you to come along.&quot;</div><div>&quot;I can't tell if that was a compliment or an insult. it was a compliment that i hope doesnt turn into an insult. I cant explain it, i just think you should come to Galveston with me and lets see where it goes.&quot;</div><div>&quot;she punched in the order for 2 numbers two and said,&quot; could you pull in over there and wait a minute for our order, I'll be right out.&quot;</div><div>&quot;ok, i gotta pay for it though.&quot;</div><div>&quot;i can take care of it.&quot; </div><div>&quot;no, you dont understand, I have to. i dont want to confuse this with something that is not. no discount, and dont quit your job either, check my id, put it on my card. I have a lot to hide, but my momma told me,&quot; you dont hide things from your doctor or your copilot.&quot; come to think of it, i rarely could ever hide anything from her either. That woman could hear me sneaking into Kuwait from across the globe.</div><div>she took his card and ID and snapped a picture.</div><div>she said, my daddy told me a couple things and i never really heard them until now.&quot;</div><div>&quot;I get that, so what did he say?&quot;</div><div>&quot;he said if i meet a man like you to bring him by the house before we take off for the moon.&quot;</div><div>&quot;fair enough. he sounds like a father. i cant wait to meet him.&quot;</div><div>&quot;well I hope you can wait a long time because he's already gone where we're planning on ending up and im in no hurry because my life just got my kind of interesting.&quot; over her shoulder she yelled out, &quot;i quit Ron, im going to Galveston.</div><div>Jake could hear the soundtrack of his soul getting ready to play. </div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></span>
