20180404 4/4 double death day shi shi
(I didn't have to explain that to the Japanese Folk)
by the way, sometimes when I am dictating my typing to Evernote you'll see "new line" "new paragraph"  or "semicolon" because the voice to text on my phone doesn't recognize them as character commands. feel free to fix that if you catch one you can refer to the scans of the papers but I often leave that behind if i get a new idea and i dont like where the proof was going.

  She had a one-track mind and today it was off
  She had a one-track mind
  that was off the tracks.
  She had a one-track mind.
  And a one-track arm apparently
  She had a one-track TARC m i n n
  And it was on the typo line to crazy
  And it was on the typo line
  out of San Diego
  and heading
  and heading to nowhere fast.
  Her mind left the track back at the station
  Along with an , two kids
  and then I'm job at the Burger Queen
  astric along with a couple of kids and ex that could bore the paint off the wall
  which is probably going to be his next "project"
  Or however he justified leaving power tools on the coffee table
  Meanwhile his first wife technically still wife teaching her kids every trick in the book on how to Pull-A-Part your ex still husband's girlfriend relationship
  "You you can have him, honey" she almost said out loud when blue eyes pulled into the drive thru in an old 4 by whatever with out of this world license plates and a smile that made her want to punch him and kiss him at the same time.
  "number 2 large with a coke, just mustard" the speaker was out so the "just come to the window" sign was up."and whatever you're having." he said out loud.
  it wasnt what she expected to hear from the looks of him. ex military probably but not a player, he was definitely not a player, the words almost sounded clumsy; but, perfectly able boys had been getting clumsy around her since as long as she coukd remember.
  "unless its a salad," he added, "we all need to eat more vegetables but I've recently decided on not starting any good habits."
  She said, "in that case, I'll make that 2 a double."  felt a chill flush her whole body. and his eyes lit up, which was remarkable because had she not seen it, she wouldn't have believed it. his eyes were already a kind of sky blue, and he knew how to look someone in the eye, like they were asking you to make a decision. and she asked herself a question, and the answer to that question was "yes."
  
  Her Daddy had been a drunk and he had also been a Marine and he liked to say that they occurred in that order. Every once in a while one of the old bastard's sayings struck a chord. He liked to talk about who was telling the Truth and about God, mostly. She used to think that was his way of apologizing, "I'm not going to sit here and play prison Warden for rules I never followed either. She's going to do what she's going to do, I can tell you that from personal experience, she's just like me you can see that plain as day, your morality doesn't fit her, at least not now."
  To her, "listen we've raised you to know the difference between right and wrong we can't tell you something because we don't even know the answers and I wish I had a better way of explaing that but the truth is always a good answer when you don't know the right one.  Other times it's less clear but honesty is how to pay for freedom in advance.  we all make mistakes, the powerful move is to own them. we want whats best for you; but, sometimes that means leaving you to fuck up here and there." He glared at my stepmother, "we want to trust you, and we do. we dont trust other people to treat you the way you deserve and you're the one that decides that. we cant teach it to you and God knows i've got my own issues when it comes to dealing with people, there's one thing I have found to be a really good compass. You are going to meet crazy people everywhere you go. Some who are creative, some who are reckless and some crazy people who are very dangerous; learn the difference. That's what makes this place amazing. Check it out, meet people, give them a fair chance to be honorable, Believe them to be who you think they are. People tell on themselves. There's one kind of person you should always be on the lookout for. It's in their eyes. you see some people know how to look you right in the eye. Those people are standing on the firmament, the rest of us are out in boats, bobbing around, thinking we know what we're doing. The truth is nobody knows anything; really: God, no God, heaven or hell, allah or cabalah, nobody really knows where it all came from and if they say they do, well, smile and walk in the other direction, the ones that have worked through their own mystery, it's written in their eyes. You will know when a person who knows the Truth looks you in the eye; because, without saying a single word, they'll get you to ask yourself a question, a real question, not like "can I be seen with him in public?" or "is she prettier than me?"  or even "am I good enough?" It's a question that sounds close to that one and you got to learn on your own to tell the difference.
The question that occurs to you is from yourself to yourself, "Am I being my best self?" and things that you don't really agree with will just fall away from your being. You'll be lucky if you meet one person in your life like that. One of you will probably screw that up; but if the stars align, you get two and one of them you get to raise kids with, well shit, that's the greatest thing a man can wish for his daughter; but, what I mean is, you follow that person, let no excuse be a reason not to face your fear and you get their number, you get their car, you drink coffee and do whatever else you know how to do; but, if you split in the middle of the night, if you don't even pack; but, that question had popped up, well I'd be the happiest man alive if you were following that dream. I think God smiles on people like that; but, until you're like 21 or so I'd appreciate you bringing him by before you head out for Mexico; or the Moon. Remember this though, the Truth is the real test. A liar is a liar to everyone and a thief of your time, the worst damage is done to the ones close to them. The truth is a mother fucker, you've got to learn how to handle it so it doesn't burn your fingers. Even the Devil has to tell the truth if you ask him the right question.
  "where are you going?" she asked blue eyes and she could tell he didnt want to be honest. she got ready for the lie. she thought she might cry, break down right there in the drive through thinking about her Dad. she hated her life she was waiting for some dickhead to try and pick her up in a burger queen drive thru. Great.
"I'm not sure where im headed, but I know where I'll end up."
  "oh yeah where is that?"
  "Dead." he said with smile, "everybody does; and, you're more than welcome to come along. I could use a co-pilot if you're up for an adventure. I'm actually really surprised at myself, I never made an offer like this."
 "when are you leaving?"
 "I left a long time ago"
 "
  
  
 "my flight instructor told me, 'you dont hide things from your doctor or your copilot,' come to think of it, I rarely could ever hide anything from him. That man could hear me sneak across the desert from over a twin turboprop."
  she took his ID and snapped a picture.
  she said, "my daddy told me a couple things and I never really heard them until now."
  "Well, what did he say?"
  "he said if I meet a man like you to bring him by the house before we take off for the moon."
  "Smart man. He must be an Astronaut. I cant wait to meet him."
  "well I hope you can wait a long time because he's already gone where we're planning on ending up and I'm in no hurry because the space between just got real interesting."
