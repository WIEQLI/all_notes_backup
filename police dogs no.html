<span><div>And another thing concerning our privacy and our rights I mean does it seem fair to you that we give animals more consideration than human being just because of you know but Francis is like drugs you got we have dogs that get the full rights and respect of police officers dumb fucking animals I mean get it straight here this is a fucking dog okay if they eat their own fucking shit okay this date they tear up a trash can just run over the fact that you haven't come home in an hour I mean dogs yet you interrupt one while he's searching your car with his nose I mean assaulting a police officer that has been trained by command tear its teeth human flesh pray but I can't defend myself against that without assaulting a police officer what the fuck is that the police have found a way to make the average human have less rights than a fucking dog just at the drop of a hat on command and by the way on command right right now anytime whatever I tell it to whatever come in a whistle I could have switched my position will do what ever I want to do that doesn't make the dog fucking smart any animal to be trained to react to command get on your fucking get on the ground put your hands in the air.. but this one how about this one put down your weapon. Now I don't Murray I am United States Marine and I got to tell you my reaction to put down your weapon probably a little different than yours okay my reaction to put down your weapon requires an assessment of the situation and I would like to argue you know that well I mean I'm going to I'm going to come up with one of those randomly-generated statistical numbers right now cuz you know that 90% of all statistics are made up on the spot and you know that the likelihood of you to believe those to tistics is there not ending in a zero except for 0 and 100 all of the statistics let's say 93% of them are more believable if they have say a 7 or 3 then they are if they have a 5 or 0 83% is more believable than 8% 87% more believable than 20% depends on which way you worded like in relation to your argument sub someone says someone's arguing for for abortion and you're in you're in disagreement with them and that you believe that abortion should not happen and you say well 27% of children born in time they were considered in situations where abortion was considered 27% of those went on to become president all people ever considered for unprovable to be either true or false nearly all statistics generated when I say nearly all I mean 93% of randomly generated statistics involved in arguments at bars when one or the other of the arguing has had more than 3% of their standard intake of alcohol on a daily sliding scale relative to humidity and barometric pressure so we see that we see by this chart that 70 to 85% otherwise known as 77.5% is or is not affected by spontaneous statistics randomly generated for the purpose of argument in useless speech and as such 84% of all argue workers involved in arguments that have resulted in the use of more than one two three read to spontaneously generated statistics will be in the kit indicative of most for all of the parties not retaining the intent of set statistics and their relation to the argument for or against whatever Point happens to have been try to defend it or opposed and by proxy will usually interrupt statement with the spontaneously generated statistics bottle of something that sounds similar to what they kind of remember about somewhere in the middle of the early argument when they were winning back to my point people yeah people people what is certain which is supposed to be uncertain which I give an uncertain uncertain that I give about a 67% well fairly certain I guess it's 67% I mean technically certain is 100% but we're humans so Kimberly give certain hundred percent uncertain would be anything below that number so let's say a certain percent uncertainty 99.9 per cent first place anything less than 100% is uncertain however we often say I am 100% certain of a thing which double positive for 100% so if you are 100% certain that you can fly well then we get into this uncertainty principle you heard of this uncertainty principle I can fly off the building and then I hit the ground some could say a hundred percent certain that I could not fly others would say for a moment and go further than if he had just Fallen but one could argue that lift lift argue that he generated. No some could say well I'm fairly certain that he flew for a moment it was Landing that I'm certain he was incapable of and others would say no heel and it definitely landed flying would be the absence of Landing to be flying it doesn't need to be the absence of Landing forever just I guess the point would be you let eleven you choose to but that's not necessarily no so could say well fairly certain that he flew for a moment it was landing that I'm certain he was incapable of another just saying she landed he definitely landed flying would be the absence of landing and others to say well to be flying it doesn't need to be the absence of landing forever just I get the point would be you let the lemon you choose to but did not necessarily flying either because sometimes you know you you got your forceful and doesn't mean you weren't flying lady tell him we were forced lands at Honolulu International Airport and tell me where like my thank God because sure its hell didn't want to go all the way to China. But then of course they're the others who think we're in the matrix in our sure that none of this is actually happening at all which I'm fairly certain could be argued later of course how that could have been percieved as true do ypu see talking about?</div><div> But back to dunks and I'm almost 100% certain which is uncertain that's right and I'm almost 100% certain that all of these Dog Handlers and I want to say like 98% of Dog Handlers love their dogs I love is hard to put a number on can we talk about can you love a dog I love you or you ultimately just a source for their sustenance a Feed Bag so to speak but only because you're the one that's been giving him you know I'm saying I mean it could be argued that training and animal right I know you love you maybe like 50% 50% of your animals love you or all of your animals love you 50% like I love my job I love my job loves me and let me tell you that was a love my dog I love my dog and then I woke up and I'm like he's parking Pittsburgh how you doing and Sparky's like he's licking my face around 1st and U Street and I'll tell you what Sparky fucking loves me that's right Sparky notice me you know what cuz I keep killing my pocket kibble kibble oh yeah and I like bacon so I probably smell like bacon and humans love bacon and you can train Youmans just like you can train a dog with stuff just like bacon I mean you could actually trained with bacon some of them I see you out there you see cuz I used to be a drug dealer and I'm and I wasn't a good drug dealer the drugs with a good drug dealer for cheaper than I could sell them which kind of makes you good at anything as well as a good singer cuz I could learn songs and sing them better than other people I meant come up with new ones which is is real nice but so you got this guy and if you want to figure out how to take a super hot chick yeah I know you're supposed to laugh and everything but what, you're supposed to be something some reality inside of it and there's a reality inside the relationship the strong relationship between really hot chicks and cocaine.</div><div><br/></div><div>I really want to get back to this dog thing the police dog thing but you see I'm conditioned as well I'm I've been trained and what I start thinking about hot chicks and cocaine I really have difficulty focusing on anything else even that really angry police dog who's been trying to take that really hot chick and then cocaine for me for ever since I can remember</div><div><br/></div><div> when remember you talking into your phone and you're doing voice recognition and picking like best times to talk about these things or the record these things remember about when is a good time and when it's not a good time.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></span>
