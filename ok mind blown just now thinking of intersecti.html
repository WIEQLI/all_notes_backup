<div><span><div>ok mind blown just now thinking of intersecting things like fractals</div><div><br/></div><div>how there are plant kingdom animal kingdom and then like fungi and then like bacteria, viruses, and so I was thinking that in terms of other dimensions</div><div>like what if there are six types of part, recepe item, piece of a puzzle on this puzzle contains the entire world but what if it was oikle a 3d no 5 6 d interlocking fractal. so in this dimension we, the human kingdom are dominant but in equally opposite  and varying degrees aronud a 6 axis construct</div><div><br/></div><div>like the tesseract</div><div><br/></div><div>lie the interliocking star of david 3d</div><div><br/></div><div>but check it out like  ther downs't need to be infinite degrees i]oin a cirlce to make the whole circle, well ok I guess but what I mean is that is fsomething completes an orbit or a coycle, thenm it is complete and why couldn't it be that there are only 6 dimensions which repeat and unfold in a constant geometric cyle, </div><div>such that each kingdom is relative to the other 6 tangential angles but in a neverending,  orbiting,  change of state exploring all possible permutations of six sides;  and in a 3 dimensional respect that is really the least amount of &quot;directions where the differences can be all equal oh wait   except 3,  actually no its intersting that these nukbners go ip doubling  o 1 2 4 but instead of going 8 or 16 depending</div><div><br/></div><div>no it goes down to 2 increment again. from 4 oints equidistant to 6 points equidistant then what? you would think 36 after that 7? following the pattern I guess you count the center point and then you realize wait  7777777777777777777777 or maybe I just figured all this out and these numbers mean someothing to me because I am the observer?</div><div><br/></div><div>17 my ucky number. 0 1 2 4 6 7 (next permutation, 6 with a tail, a connector, but it's in the middle (like a bellybutton) instad of outside (like a tail) because for us the outside of the inside in a place we can't concieve at the other side of the middle/inside possibky the dark matter / inverse universe filling the space between the positive universe with its exact / nesting opposite</div><div><br/></div><div>wow man I'm blown aways  like an alternating space that someohow interacts wiht the diamertrically appoosed existence and space (or no space)  that is,  the outside of the inside that we are perceiving ourselves as &quot;in&quot;  but you see,  the connector, the knot in the balloon,  so to speak,  wouldn't exist outside because we are at the opposite, we are the smooth construct and so the belly button (and that's probably not a coincidence, is a spot that was the filler place but it's dimensionally, therfore completely the opposite of our experience is actually whereever the middle is, sort of like our bodies,  and that belly button is another existance  another world but that world would  kill us, we coudn't exist and explore that space at the same time, like the niary existance the difference  between  what is and  what isn't is the oppposite but its not just one because we can't concieve that. it exists unopposed in the space we are incapable of understanding and so not just one but since we can't conceive of 6 opposites, that is what it is,  but 2 versions, one where you can only get up to 6 or 7 equidistant points, we understand that space because it is our full reality, but just as we are conscious and unconscious, so is that other world real and unreal in impossible  (and possible) permutations which we can&quot;t and therefore maybe can understand, fathom the negative place that iwen't there AND AND AND I can understand it only as far as I can't understand the ununderstandable. at each door of perceptions as I work out what I'm able to understand , equally  impossible permutations of past or not quite infinite permutations.  etc etc, each veil places me in a construct  which I have to accept as a condition is imposible and then again in a way I cannot fathom yet and in doing so I just went infinite</div><div><br/></div><div>therefore it never ends until a place where you sayk OK this is endless, let's see if there's somehting more important to be doing but 90 it the next level is something maybe smaller this time, until  massive expansion reaches it's limit and it starts to suck back in from all over space and time back to a singular instance and point when mass was infinite and some was the vaccuum around  it or possibly inside  it  and infinite inside surroundded by an infinite outside.and this is Krisna I say, knowing that it could never ever ever matter, mattermatter ever not matter ever matter not</div><div>see ever matter no\t space not matter  not ever not not extra extra build mattertimes 6 to the 6 and then extra but not ouside, extra begin inside and then that 0 that 1 that two spin two, fourteen not 16, 6 and then not 12 but 7 and then 7 is extra but (unknown value of time and space and ?partroneum) </div><div><br/></div><div>so you thought I forgot about the 6 kingdoms right? well I didn't cause that's the part why i decided to start writing this in the first place cause I thought  &quot;ok like  animal, plant,  microorganism,  but no it's like virus and maybe fungus and then.... no how about the color kingdom and then the 7 in the middle is just the black and white, or the sound kingdom,  or the electrical kingdom and there of course has to be one that is the exactly complete opposite of the whole construct. so the 7 exists in the absence of the 7 in the mirrored, inverse color space where the blacks is white but actiually not in the mirror, it's the opposite so it's actually in the SAME space but the negative and that is the close of the circle loop it's the opposite of it at the opposite  of not it which is IT!!!!</div><div><br/></div><div>only it's also, it  has the next increment but not increment it's actually ually the opposite of the not opposite of the not anymore (just a little bit more and so I was ready to download it all finally the whole cascade of the knowledge and then I realized the rest of the knowledge in in the negativce place of the not me. which is me only not me plus a little</div><div><br/></div><div>and then I was thking that it's the numbers that are dead in our version of the  universe, the actual numbers like the numbers and constant, s the concept of numbers and linear structure that is immovable; and we are in constant motion changing state, well maybe in our opposite universe we are  ,. maybe that's is what is not alive in the oppositeof the inverse ofr me plas a little. maybe in that opposite universe that we lack the ability to comprehend, we com-pretend that numbers are alive and we are not.</div><div><br/></div><div>and what is that you ask? casue I must know, it goes that where I'm going is just the opposite of who I'm going to be and goes tot show that the opposite of where I'm going  is where I came from, plus the opposite of a little more than me would be </div><div>\</div><div>the mother</div><div>becasue the opposite of where I am and who I cam which is exactly when I entered and where minus me, so on the other side of the mother is the inverse of me and the opposite of ewwhere I am which is where I cam not but also not me so basically, here and now. about to realize that I know nothing compare to the next phaselooking back when I will realize that I'm walkig through anoother door, only doors are over now and so are words...  so if you are looking to figure it all out, it makes sense that we are seeking the f]doorway back from whence we've come which would require that we somewhoe  faold back in to the first han]mver and somehow pass back throuh the placental wal, or up the tubes ad created again when she was created and you were just an egg and they say that a woman is born with all of her eggs and if you think of that, that short time of no egg, egg, no egg, egg, there is a chain of time where things are created and then they sit like a bullet in the chamber and in a non linear way, it's almost like we all are created almost at the sametime</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>and so I find myself looking at the structure of hydro carbon attom and I'n thinking waut a minute three hydrogens and a Carbon then another three hydrogens and a carbon and what if they looked like the 3d version of a star of dacid intersecting triangle pyramids wihe the carbons opposite sdes oudie of the toher triange facing opposite and not like a mirror but actally occupying the same space interlocking </div><div><br/></div><div>like a three dimensional mandelbrot set, all colors and ratios and relations explored in a complete lloop able to infinitely zoom in and out until the whole is unfolded back into itself</div></span>
