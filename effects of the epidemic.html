<span><div>Today I learned about the the first phase in the attempt to curb the &quot;new&quot; opium epidemic. A Korean War Veteran friend just moved to San Diego and I took him to the VA today where I found out that his opiate pain medication prescription was canceled a few days ago, per executive order This is a man with terminal cancer. He said to me, &quot;Dave, I take the pills so I can work, so I can get things done, I don't get high, I hate how they make me groggy.&quot;</div><div><span style="line-height: 1.45;">He was taking somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 mg of </span><a href="https://www.rxlist.com/oxycontin-drug.htm" style="line-height: 1.45;">Oxycontin</a><span style="line-height: 1.45;"> daily and they mentioned something about decreasing</span><span style="line-height: 1.45;"> his dose but no one followed up on it and two days ago he ran out. He has no idea what is about to happen to his body as he goes through opiate withdrawal. He said to me today</span><span style="line-height: 1.45;"> (day 2) &quot;well I think I'm over the withdrawals , I had the shakes yesterday and I think I made it OK.&quot;</span></div><div>I had no idea what to say to him, I had no way to explain the condition he's about to experience without legitimate treatment, which he won't be able to get until he gets a primary physician in two weeks.</div><div>Before you think I have it out for the VA I must tell you that I have gotten great treatment at the VA, I have no complaints whatsoever of the procedures and health care that I have received in the last 18 years. I want that to be really clear, I have gotten excellent treatment at the VA. This is not about the VA, These doctors and nurses did not decide to suddenly cut off prescriptions to veterans all across the US. This is a result of a mandate that starts at the very top; and in my opinion, the impact will result in a situation that could spell disaster to our country. You might be reluctant to agree with this, after all we are in the midst of an Opiate Epidemic and something must be done.</div><div>I agree.</div><div>Something must be done; but, removing access to pain medication for Veterans is a powderkeg that sits at the foundation of our nation.</div><div>Here is why: in recent years there has been a popular description of the cycle of abuse of opiates; Often it begins innocently with an injury or a surgery,with a prescription and then, for one reason or another, the abuse of medication and when the provision is insufficient, sometimes patients seek alternatives in the Black market, finally the patient is trying to find street drugs to compensate for what has become a deadly dependency to these substances, and I agree with that progression as a legitimate explanation for why many people who one wouldn't otherwise expect to take heroin have been found victims to this result. It is an epidemic after all, there are hundred of thousands, maybe millions of people suffering from these substances.</div><div>I agree and have several friends who are now sober who describe this very situation as their path to abuse. I want to use it as an example of what I think is about to happen to a whole generation of Veterans who have just been cut off from their previously available medication</div><div>Taking that model and applying it to the Veterans of the last few wars, one must also look at another phenomenon of the progression of the drug user, and that is the evolution of the user to the person who is trying to allay costs to continue providing their own pain treatments</div><div>This phenomenon is what i like to call &quot;soft dealing&quot; where a person who has a large chunk of their income realize that they can buy in volume and  save money by sharing the costs with a group of friends in a similar situation. I can tyell you from a personal experience that this seems incredibly innocent and even benificent as you are helping a bunch of people reduce costs.</div><div>Unfortunately, it often progresses further. This is not a speculation, this is an actual account of how almost every drug dealer got started in their business.</div><div>I wish it weren't so; and, I would love to think that the honor and pride and moral integrity of your average military personell would keep a former serviceperson froim going down this road; but, when one has an experience with a substance like painkillers that help a person continue to work and feel useful and effective and able to provide for their family, well, like me, they begin to think that the drug shouldn't be illegal, that access to this is something that is beneficial for them and others. I am telling you this from experience. I am not talking about recreational use, I am talking about treatment for a legitimate condition and the need for people to feel as though they contribute and are valuable. This is a basic human need and many people use painkillers not for the effect as much as for the way that it enables them to return to being useful, effective, productive members of their social units.</div><div>Now, having had some experience with members of the black market I can say that there are definitely gradients of the criminal infrastructure. some &quot;criminals&quot; are just regular folks that don't see their business as any more harmful than going a little over the speed limit or failing to use a turn signal. They're just providing a service that allows them to feed the family and put together a little something for retirement. Soimetimes it was a mistake they made earlier than life that makes it hard for them to get a good paying reggular job, sometimes thjey just don't want to be a slave to the establishment. Then you have some really hardcore, professional psychopaths out there with every increment of personality in-between. Just as there are wide variety of professionalism and unprofessional behavior or discipline in any industry, so too you have the entire spectrum of humanity in alternative markets. It can be as innocent as the &quot;outlaw&quot; who just doesn't trust the government and then there are predators out there, some guys just think you shold be able to smoke a little reefer and some guys are living way outside the lines. </div><div>It's important to me that you understand that I have the highest respect for the members of our Armed Services. that I am not disparaging the military in any way; rather, what I'm saying is this: There is a spectrum, a variety of levels in all industry.</div><div><span style="line-height: 1.45;">I can hear the jeers from here.</span></div><div><span style="line-height: 1.45;">What I can assure you will happen; possibly very rarely and potentially very frequently, is this:</span></div><div><span style="line-height: 1.45;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="line-height: 1.45;">The </span>Military<span style="line-height: 1.45;"> Veteran who migrates, for whatever reason, off the grid, is </span>not<span style="line-height: 1.45;"> a new or unfamiliar story. As military members ultimately find themselves in these situations because they have been cut off from treatment, they will begin to see how they could do this with efficiency, how they can protect people and how they can do an honorable service in an alternative market and they will slowly infiltrate this infrastructure, and they will develop efficient and disciplined organizations, and they will have the kind of experience which will make the underworld infrastructure in this country a very formidable and cunning factor in the way this country works. The Organized Crime Syndicates which were emboldened and facilitated by the 18th Amendment (Prohibition) did not have anywhere near the technological or structural advantage that this situation could potentially enable.</span></div><div><br/></div><div>A criminal infrastructure with access to the training and knowledge of tactics and equipment which is readily available on the dark web today would also have members who have stood side by side and developed close personal relationships with their friends and comrades who left the Military to continue their service in Law Enforcement and other governmental agencies. That is a very dangerous set of intricate relationships. Before you think I am besmirching the reputation o0f the Armed Forces I would BEG you to take a look at this possible scenario and simply imagine &quot;what if?&quot;</div><div>I don't know if you have ever seen what it's like to withdrawal from an opiate or to suffer from chronic pain with medication but I have seen it and it is a horrible sight. I don't know if you have ever had to sit and listen to an opiate dependent person you love, suffer through this; but, I have, and I can tell you that I would have done anything I could to end that person's pain.</div><div>I hope you don't have to experience that ghastly situation. It looks like I'm getting ready to do it again probably starting tomorrow.</div><div>I can hear some of you saying how wrong I am to suggest this and I want to stress that this opinion that I write has nothing to do with my agenda to make prohibition items legal. This has to do with the terrible decision that this country's leaders are making by removing access to Veteran's Medication in an effort to reduce Opiate Abuse. That is not a slur on our leaders, it is a wake up call to those who would make these decicsions without considering the impact of this action. We are about to turn our back on our servicepersons who have been injured and remain in treatment after injuries sustained while protecting this country and in doing so, we will be putting an entire nation in jeopardy.</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="line-height: 1.45;">will be that the limiting of access to and the rationing of chronic opiate patients' medicine will send a disciplined, trained, weaponized, combat-experienced group of post-war men and women to into the black market for relief, the next progression is that these persons will begin to take up positions in criminal organizations eventually making them more organized, familiar with government tactics and military equipment and having close personal relationships with their former comrades who took up positions in law enforcement and other government agencies.</span></div><div><br/></div><div> as we get more acquainted with the meetoo movement we are learning about despicable behavior in even the most professional and legitimate environments. I can assure you that no such recourse is available to persons who are subject to the same types of behavior in the Black Market.</div></span>
