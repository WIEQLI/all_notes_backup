<span><div style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><div>you know addiction is a real problem in this world. In this country especially , what with the drug laws being what they are and all these addicts, just being stigmatized.  I mean, c'mon people, you got mom's and dad's giviong their babies adderal, which by the way is NEARLY IDENTICAL to crytal meth, form the time their little kids and you expect them not to have a fucking addiction to that shit?  Wake the fuck up, you're setting your chi8ldren up for failure.</div><div><div><br/></div>
We got the 24/7 world and we're trying to keep up and we're not understanding why are children's brains have already adapted and are going a million miles a minute but you see no it's not good for you, for your schedule, you need some down tome so instead of raising your kids properly you sedate them or drug them up and send them outsidfe so Moimmy and Daddy can get some fucking rest.
<div><br/></div>
what the fuck do you expect you fucking assholes?
<div><br/></div>
and then you're going to stigmatize some guy who figures out that it feels a lot better, last longer and cost a lot fucking less if he just goes down to his buddy on the corner and rolls a pipe or puts it right in his arm... thenyou're going to look at that guy and call him an asshole, he smells like piss, can't get into treatment cause insurance companies ponly want the paying customers and guess what?  THAT&quot;S YOUR FUCKING KID IN 20 YEARS MOM!
<div><br/></div>
with all due credit to my mom, she has nothing to do with my addiction problems.  I had to figure that shit out on my own which is why I didn't start shooting crytal meth until I was almost 42 but basically, you know, like THANKS MOM&lt; if you'd have gotten me on the shit sooner I might have made something of my life by now.
<div><br/></div>
I mean here we are in 2015, with all kinds of technology and we're really still just pumping ourselves full of the same shit we've been dealing with for 5000 years.  Heroin, shrooms, meth, and pot. basically some cats just figure out how to market them, or Black Market them and make a killing off of feeding us what we really want.  serenity, even if it's just for a minute.  and I got news for you, if you don't know it already... Coffee = cocaine.  Have you ever seen someone who needs coffee and can't get any? Fucking Cocaine.. Adderal/Ritalin etc..  Meth. seriously all adderall is is amphetamine with a time release and people are feeding this to their kids.  adults are sucking these things down like tictacs and then giving some addict in the street the heavcy lookdown. Hey buddy, listen, you don't have ADD or ADHD, you have A-D-D-I_C-T-I-O-N is what you have. You're an addict, you just still have your house and a doctor who is giving you that shit.  At least an addict is being honest about it, getting it for cheaper and then adminstering his dose, yhe's like an MD! yeah, he's a professional.  You wouldn't believe the medical procedures I've seen administered by addicts on themselves and each other.  I have a buddy, who saved my fickiung life by the way, I mean this guy knows every pharmaceutical name, all contraindications, detox methods, street value, insurance forms, this guy really knows his shit.  I mean he can explain the differences between ten different types of benzodiazapines better than any pharma drug reop I ever me.. why, because he's HONEST about that they do AND because he's tried them all..  A LOT.
<div><br/></div>
This guy would make Keith Richards look like a candy striper.. I mean I know some candy stripers would make keith Richards look like a candy striper. I mean it's systemic folks. the problem is systemic.  I mean, OK look at me, I had almost 7 years of sobriety, clean living and I went out and burned my entire life down in about a year. I've been sober again now for a couple years (no don't clap for that seriously) i mean, I had no choice otherwise I would have still been using, and even today with all the stuff in my life, entertaining, fulfilling stuf a family, great wife, whatever, .. if I went back into that green room tonight and there was a bunch of crystal and some syringes back there and I knew a good connect and thought I could get away with it, well I'd probably have completely reorganized my life by this time next week. Once you've tasted that stuff, you will always remember it.  I din't get here on my own, man I have a support group around me of pother cats that did what I did and we ask God for help.  I hate to say that cause I know a bunch of you have a problem with God.  So did I, I had an intense resentment for a being which I would have told you didn't exist.  Oh I'd have told you I was mad at religion and sure there's plenty of shenanigans going on in that group of assholes but the real reason is that I was mad at God for not letting me know he was there.  So if you hafve a problem with God, and you don't believe in God, maybe you know what I'm talking about. Like check this out.  Do you have a problem with Hitler right now.  I mean he was a pretty fucked up dude, but do you have a problem with him, I mean is he going to jump ouyt of the closet and skin you for a drum or something, no, I don't think so anyway...  He's fucking dead.  I mean you could have a problem with his folowers or something but whatever, I don't run into that crowd much cause I don't run with them but anyway, so here's the thing, how do I have a problem with a Dude that simultaneously I'm saying I don't believe in?  Or can't know.  Yeah I'm pissed cause if this cat is supposed to be running shit, then I NEED TO TALK TO HIM, RIGHT AWAY, ON THE PHONE&lt; Facetime me, shype whatever, HE NEEDS TO ANSWER FOR SOME SHIT RIGHT AWAY.  And that's the way I looked at iot. right?  IF that's the way you look at it, come find me, we can talk. IT's my favorite fucking subject\. If you all believe in God and shit's all honky dory and all, stay over there. I don't understand you, I ain't trying to understand you and what the fuck do you need to talk to me for anyway if you're life is so FUCKING AWESOME what with you and God and all that shit, get your validation somewhere else man.
<div><br/></div>
I'm sure it always was but we didn't really notice it on the global level these days with social meadia and reality TV. still
<div><br/></div>
a lot of addictions go unnoticed these days,
<div><br/></div>
I mean like the gym, right, you hear that all the time<br/>
I'm addicted to working out&quot;<br/>
I'm like, yeah and what'<br/>
s the problem, you look like ever wet dream I ever had since I was 12.  Seriously. WTF. the only problem with that addiction is that if I am going to have any chance at all I'm going to have to get addicted to the gym too.  And I don't like the gym.  I mean, endorphins are nice and all but once you've figured out that you can get that shit straight from the dealer and mainline it right there in your jugular vein, I mean, c'mon, that gyms stuff looks pretty fucking pointless.
<div><br/></div>
certain kinds of food addictions, shopping addiction like paying bills...
<div><br/></div>
why can't I get addicted to paying my bill on time, or wait no, EARLY! like man, someone is like WTF is wrong with you? you never have any money! and I'd be like, yeah I couldn't help myself, I was up late last night and I don't know what happened but I looked at my credit card bill this morning and apparently my cable bill is paid up til next September.  But honetsly I'm a little worried cause Hockey season starts around then and I don't want to miss any of those games...
<div><br/></div>
My buddy let's call him Joao,<br/>
I just want to you to think I have brazilian freinds<br/>
this guy can't stop cleaning his teeth, I mean he goes through like ten or twenty of those funny looking bow and arrow tooth picks things a day. They're all over his aprtment, the trash can, everywhere I look I see thes fucking little green bow and arrows with the long tail, it's driving me fucking crazy, I'm like &quot;Your teeth are clean motherfucker!&quot; get over it! Meanwhile, I'm missing three in the back, but that's another story, kinda funny, but probably not good for this crowd...
<div><br/></div>
Like I know this guy, he's addicted to broccoli<br/>
Fucking broccoli, I know right? He grows hi own in the backyard.  He's got all manner of tools and pumps and lights and irrigation systems.  Helicopters are flying over to see wtf is going on in there, the police are coming over and he's like, &quot;Nope, Just Broccoli&quot;<br/>
it madness. I mean he's got every kind of broccoli, blue broccoli purple broccoli,skinny broccoli, fat broccoli, tall, short, he's even got this broccoli that looks like corn. 2 acres of fucking broccoli and you couldn't grow one fucking ear or corn could you?  No it's gotta be Beoccoli corn.
<div><br/></div>
People have fuckin problems, traffic, traffic is killing me.  I'm glad the gas prices are so high, I mean think about it, you'd think that if the gas went way up there'd be less people on the road but no, these motherfuckers spend 4 bucks a gallon to sit in traffic. and they drive like assholes.
<div><br/></div>
I'm on the road the other day and this guy is driving 55 mph, not one of these 90 year olds with their glasses practically glued to the windshield,  You ever see these people, of course you have, you've been to the casino, I mean seriously, no wonder they get out of the car all bent over and stuff, there's liike in the car, all bent over , it's like their car is a walker or something.
<div><br/></div>
why don't they have corrective lens wind-shields by the way,<br/>
I mean, that would be cool.
<div><br/></div>
anyway, so I'm having a road rage moment, you know where you like pretend you're going to follow the guy.  I like to pretend I'm a cop, you know, like just be a real asshole and follow them for miles and miles out of my way, and then just slide right past them like, I saw what you did, there that illegal lane change, back there, you went over six solid lines, that's like 70 bucks per tire per line buddy, you owe the state like 7 thousand dollars and I just want you to know I was rtight there behind you the whole time, in fact now I owe the state 7000 bucks just cause I was doing that and I'm just going to make sure you know that I know, we both are fucked because you can't control yourself.
<div><br/></div>
right so I'm having this road rage moment and I follow this guy to the gas station, I mean he didn't go over the speed limit once.  in the fast lane the whole time. I'm really livid, I mean I just want to go punch this guy, he's fucking up the whole flow of traffic and so I pull in to the gas station., real close, right behind him, with my billy bad ass marine corps sticker sitting right up there on the windshield.
<div><br/></div>
and I go up to him, and I'm like, buddy, what's your problem man, you know you were doing 55 mph for the last 15 miles.. (which means of course that so was I...
<div><br/></div>
and he's like, yeah man, I'm sorry, I have a real problem.  I'm addicted to the speed limit...  My dad, my mom, my whole family, none of us understand why we do it.  my life is totally fucked, I'm early for everything too.  I mean I show up like an hour early for work sometimes.  I just can't stop.
<div><br/></div>
and I'm like, uhh, yeah, fuck man, I wish I could, like, I don't know is there anywhere you can go for that?
<div><br/></div>
he's like, nah, we've tried, I'm sorry man.  I'll try to speed a little next time.
<div><br/></div>
oh and thank you for your service.
<div><br/></div>
I'm like FUCK YOU.<br/>
it's called OCD motherfucker, live a little.!</div><div><br/></div><div>You probably give ar space gap in a parking lot</div></div></span>
